Plutarch IlInsic: The second establishment of
music at Sparta is best ascribed to Thaletas of
Gortyn, Xenodamus of Cythera, Xenocritus of Locri,
Polymnastus of Colophon and Sacadas of Argos . .
Thaletas, Xenodamus, and Xenocritus were com-
posers of paeans . . though according to some
authorities, as for instance Pratinas, Xenodamus
composed hyporchemes and not paeans. There is
actually a song of Xenodamus' on record, which is
obviously a hyporcheme . . As to Xenocritus, who
was by birth of Locri in Italy, it is questioned
whether or no he was a composer of paeans, because
we are told that he wrote poems on ‘heroic ' subjects,
and that some writers therefore called his works
dithyrambs. According to Glaucus, Thaletas was
an older contemporary of Xenocritus.1

Plutarch Music: We are told that the last lyrist
to win the prize for lyre—song at the Spartan Carneia
was a Lesbian called Pericleitus ; 2 his death put an
end to the continuous succession of Lesbian singers
to the lyre. Some writers are mistaken in making
Hipponax a contemporary of Terpander. The truth
would appear to be that he comes later even than
PericleituS.
