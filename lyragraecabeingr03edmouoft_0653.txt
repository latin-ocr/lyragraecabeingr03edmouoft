ANACREON

Lyrio poetry, the fourth his Iambic, and the fifth his
Elegiae. Among his Elegies were Drinking-Songs,
{gigiaffghs and other InscriptionS, and perhaps in-

The use of metre for inscriptions was a survival of the
very early days when all ‘ literature,’ all that is that was
composed for record or repetition, tended to be metrical,
partly through long association with the (lance, and
partly because verse—which is not at that stage dis-
tinguishable from song—aids the memory. That the
early Greek inscriptions were first in Hexameters ¹ and
then in the Elegiae metre‚² points to the early separation—-
in this order—of Epos and Elegy from music. These
were now the natural speech-metres.

One of Anacreon’s Inscriptions appears to have
been written for the grave of a fellow-countryman
who fell in the battle which broke the resistance of
the natives of Abdera3 another is the dedication of
a votive effigy for the victory of the horse of Phoi-
. dolas of Corinth at Olympia. The subjects of the
Iambics seem to have been various, but all personal,
and many of them, as would be expected, satirical.
The most famous of these is the charming little
piece, composed perhaps at Abdera, to the Thracian
coquette. This must have been either sent as a
letter, or sung—or recited—at a drinking-bont,
perhaps both.

The metres of this Book owe much to the tradition of
Archilochus, but also, like those of Ibycus, betray the new-
Lesbian strain by the use of Choriambs. It is to be
noted that the only two extant poems of any length aro
divisible into strophes of two and three lines respectively.
The Melic poetry included Hymns, Love-Songs—one at
least in the form of a Hymn——, Partheneia, and (what adds
the last and most lasting touch to the traditional picture
of this lover of lads‚ lasses, wine, and music) songs of
regret for past youth. The Choral poems, of which we
have the little Hymn dedicating a temple or statue of
Artemis at the Ionian Magnesia, and a new and doubtfully
restored fragment from the Maiden-Songs‚ show no ad-
