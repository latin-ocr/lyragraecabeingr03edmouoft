Philo Thac every Uprz'fft ᾹῙαη is Free: The Athenian
general Miltiades, when the king of the Persians rallied the
flower of the youth of Asia to his standard and crossed to
Europe with an enormous host, to capture Graece, as he
thought, without a blow, assembled the Allies at the
Panathenaic stadium and, as a visual exhorta-tion likely to
prove more effective than any speech⁷ showed them some
cock-fighting. Nor was he disappointed. then the spectators
saw the endurance and the feeling of honour which abides
even unto death in these dumb creatures, they flew to arms
like men ready to give their lives, without thought of wound
or slaughter, if only they might be buried in the soil of a
free country. For there can be no better inducement to the
increase of courage than an increase of confidence in hopes
for the future. This cock-fight is referred to by the tragic
poet Ion in the following passage ε

His body and his twin eyes smitten, he yet for-
getteth not his might, not he, though his utterance
is weak 3 nay, he preferreth death to servitude.
