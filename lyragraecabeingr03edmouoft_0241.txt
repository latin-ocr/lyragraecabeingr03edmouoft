An Inscription of the First or Second Century [found near
the temple of Asclepius 011 the slope of the Acropolis at

Athens] :
Sophocles :—

O renowned daughter [of Phlegyas, sweet]
mother of [Asclepius] warder-off of woe, [whom]
the unshorn [Phoebus] numbered among his
[loves, to thee we will sing now with tunes] set

to noble words . . .

¹ for this epithet in a Paean to Asclepius cf. Adesp.
129 (was this Sophocles' Paean ?) and Kaibel Epiy. 1026
² perh. part of the same Paean3 some think the title
‘Sophocles' may be merely the name of the dedicator, but
in any case the poem would seem to be a good deal earlier
