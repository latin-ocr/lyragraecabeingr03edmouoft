ALCMAN

contained fourteen or sixteen stanzas, of which we have
eight. Of these the first three contain the end of the
myth of Heracles’ revenge on the sons of Hippocoon, and
the last five praise of the chorus and references to the
occasion and the hoped-for victory in the competition.
The phrase νεάνιδες ἰρήνας ἐράτας ἐπέβαν is either an
anticipation of this victory or, perhaps more likely, a
reference to the object of the rituaL thanksgiving after
war. That peace in that sense particularly affected the
Spartan maidens is clear from the Aryumc‘nt to Theocritus
(p. 2 l. 7 Wendel).1 The poem seems to have been sung
and danced at dawn in procession to the temple of Orthia.
The chorus apparently was composed of cousins, or at
least members of the same tribe. What lies behind the
comparison of the leader and vice-leader to horses and
doves,—ritual, coterie-trick, or traditional type of meta-
phor—we cannot tell ; but it is worth noting that early
ivories found in her precinct show Orthia surrounded by
birds. Other fragments addressed to the Dioscuri, to
Zeus Lycaeus, to Hera, to ArtemiS, to Aphrodite, may well·
come from Partheneia.

From these fragments we should judge that these
Maiden·Songs began with an address to the Muse and
an invocation of the God to whom they were sung.
Then came the myth3 and then the personal part——
praise or banter sometimes in the poet’s name and
sometimes in the chorus’ own—with references to the
competition, the prize, the judges, and so on.² In
one delightful fragment, where Alcman complains
that he is getting too old to dance with his maidens,
the implication is that in his day, as in that of
Archilochus before him, the poet was the ἐξάρχων,
the leader of the dance, in more than name. The
Love-SongS, of which we have one very chal-ming

1 ‘ the maidens being hidden away owing to the disturbance
caused by the Persian WVar, certain country fellows entered the
temple of Artemis and lauded the Goddess with their own songs ’
² fr. 2A, where the girls apparently address the poet, is said to
have come at ‘the beginning of the 2nd Partheneion’3 but the
fragment would make a strange beginning, and it is unlikely
that the pattern of a ritual ode of this period should have been
so elastic; we should perhaps translate ‘ at the beginning of the
2nc1 Book of the Partheneiaq’
