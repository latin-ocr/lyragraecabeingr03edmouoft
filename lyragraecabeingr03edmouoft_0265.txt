CINESIAS

Lm:

Plato the Comedy-writer z Next comes the son of
Oeagrus by Pleurisy‚l Cinesias‚ scraggy and rump-
less, with legs like reeds‚ prophet of Dechne,
branded in the flesh with many a cautery-mark of
Euryphon's.2

Plato Gorg-ias: SocuA'rEs and CALL1CLEsz—S.
First let us consider flute-playing. Do you not
think, Callicles, that its sole object is our pleasure?
—C. Yes.—S. And isn't this true of all such arts,
sor instance of competitive lyre-playing ?-C. It is.
S. And how about the training of choruses and the
composition of dithyrambs ? Is it not the same with
them? Do you suppose that Cinesias son of Meles
concerns himself to say something that shall be
improving to hear, or something that shall make
him popular?—-C. Obviously the latter, Socrates, is
the object of Cinesias.-—S. And what of his father
Meles? Was his singing to the lyre inspired by the
highest motive ? Whatever may be said of the son,
is it not true that the father's ideal was not even
the greatest possible pleasure to his audience? At
any rate his singing annoyed them.3 Be that as it
may, do you not agree that both arts, singing to
the lyre and the composition of dithyrambs, were
invented in order to give pleasure ?-C. Yes.4
