BACCHYLI DES

wove a shrewd—sorrowful device for Deianeira, when
she learnt the woeful news that the fray-undaunted
son of Zeus was sending white-armed Iole to his
shining house for to become his bride. Alas, poor
miserable, and again alas! that she should make
such a plot as that. Her ruin was wide-mighted
Jealousy and the murky veil that hid the future, the
day she received from Nessus upon Lycormas’ rose-
clad marge 1 that marvellous gift divine.2

THE YouNG ΜΕΝ AND MAmENs or THESEUS

Lo a blue-prowed ship clave the Cretan main
with Theseus staunch·i’-the din aboard and twice
seven splendid youths and maids3 of race Ionian,
for northern breezes fell on her far-gleaining canvas
by grace of Athena of the warring aegis. And
Minos' heart was pricked by the fell gifts of the
love-crowned Darne of Cyprus, till he could no more
hold off his hand from a maid but touched her fair
white cheeks. Then loud cried Eriboea upon the
brazen-cuissed seed of Pandion,4 and Theseus saw,

1 of Euenus, a river of Aetolia ² the poisoned shirt
with which she killed Her-acles ³ cf. Serv. Aen. 6. ‘21
(Bacchylides in Dithyrambz‘s); these young Athenians were
the periodic tribute (the period varies in the different
account-s from one year to nine), paid to the Minotaur at
Cnosus ⁴¹ father of Aegeus reputed father of Theseus
