ARCHILOCHUS

higher melody than what you sing,1 whereas all the poets
before him played the same notes as they sang.’

It is clear, judging him merely from the technical
standpoint, that we have to do here with a great
poet-musician. But Archilochus was great for other
reasons. N ot only is he thefirst satirist, but* with
the partial exception of Hesiod he is the earliest
person of our western civilisation that we know from
a portrait drawn by himself.

His works as preserved in antiquity comprised Eleyies,
Ictmbics (including Trochaics), Epodes, Inscriptions (that,
is epitaphs and votive labels), and a Book of Hymns
addressed mostly to Dionysus and called Ἰόβακχοι.
In the E leyics he says : ‘ Ι am the servant of lord Enyalius,
yet I am also versed in the lovely gift of the Muses.’ And
this: ‘ In the spear is my kneaded bread, in the spear my
Ismarian wine, Ι recline when Ι drink on the spear.’
And again ι ‘ Ali me ἕ lifeless I lie in the toils of Desire,
pierced through and through with the intolerable pains
the Gods have given me.’

These little fragments suffice to show that a. new
thing has arisen in Greek poetry, the personal poem.
The fame of Archilochus, as the mere preservation
of his poems testifies, was Panhellenic. His Iambic
H ymn of Victory to H eracles, originally sung ‘ for his
own victory at Paros in the Hymn to Demeter ’
became something like ² the Greek equivalent of
our ⁶ See the conquering hero comes,’ itself originally
written for a particular, though imaginary, occasion.

To sum up, we may ask what do we feel as chiefly
distinguishing Archilochus from the Epic poets?
Not so much his metres, different through these are,

1 Cf. Plat. Laws 812d, Arist. Prob. 9. 39. 9212.. 25 (Gevaert);
in this ancient approximation to modern ‘ harmony ’ the
accompaniment took the higher note, Ib. 12. 918a. 373 that it
never involved more than two ‘parts,’ which converged ulti-
mately on the keynote, is clear from Ib. 16. 918b. 30; both
melody and accompaniment could be played by a single per-
former on the double-fiute, Apul. Flor. l; the same was done
by the lyre, neither hand being used for ‘stopping ’; fiute-
melodies so rendered would presumably have a range only
of a ‘ fifth: lyre-melodies of an octave 2 it was rather less
formal; ‘ chairing ' would be perhaps a nearer parallel
