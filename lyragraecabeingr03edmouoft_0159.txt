a moi-tal thou shouldest nurse two opinions, this,
that thou wilt see but one more morrow’s sunlight,
and the other that thou wilt have fifty years of a life
of ample wealth. Cheer then thy heart by righteous
deeds, for therein is the highest of all gains.’

sky is not to be deffled, the water of the sea doth not
decay, gold cannot be tarnished ; but a man, he may
not pass by hoary eld and then recover blooming
youth.l Yet virtue’s lightwaneth not with a man’s
body, but is cherished by the Muse. Thou, HierO,
hast displayed before men the fairest of flowers3
and one that hath succeeded getteth no honour of
silence; so there shall be a true tale of things well
done, and along with it men shall praise the grace
of the honey-tongued nightingale of Ceos.2
