POETRY IN GREEK EDUCATION

snnposia, he did not find the literary part of his
education become a thing of the past, put away
with his childish clothes and his long curls3 but when
the wine and dessert came on he would take his
turn in singing or reciting poetry, and his choice
was not always the latest thing from the θαύματα-
such as Theophrastus' Late-Learner sits out several
performances to get by heart-—but often what he
had learnt at school, a ῥῆσις from Euripides or a
song to his own accompaniment from Alcaeus or
Anacreon.

This love of music and poetry doubtless goes back
to the dim time when the two arts were one. Plato
above, like the inscriptions, calls the children’s
Ρ6110111131106ῥαψῳδία, and says that they ‘sang ’
Solon’s elegies. These terms are survivals from that
time. HOMER makes Achilles sing to the lyre the
‘ renowns of men,’ which, with songs like the profes-
sional minstrel's Lay os the W 0οάοη Horse and The
Love os Ares and Aphrodite, seem to have been the
material out of which 1116 two great Epics were

‘stitched’ But besides music, early poetry had
another constituent, the dance. For just as voice
and gesture are di'fferentiations, we may believe,
from a single activity, the cominunication of ideas,
so song, poetry, and dancing, as we know them,
are differentiations from the song—dance which
primitive peoples still rega-td as a single whole.
Although neither the civilisation described by Homer
nor—so far as we 0311 distinguish it from the other—
11131 of the time in which he lived, can be called
primitive in the anthropologist’s sense, the Iliad
contains survivals from this stage of development.

It is clear for instance that μολπή and μέλπεσθαι some-
times mean much more than song and singing. Hector
says, boasting (7. 241): ‘1 know how to charge into
the mellay of swift chariots, and how to do song-dance
(μέλπεσθαι) 10 furious Ares in close battle) In three
places of the Iliad we find the phrase κυνῶν μέλπηθρα

γενέσθαι ‘ become a song-dance of dogs‚' that is their
sport. In both these instances it is the dauco rather
