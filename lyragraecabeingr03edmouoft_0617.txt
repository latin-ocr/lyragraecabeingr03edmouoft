THE ELEGIAC DISTICH

Hexameter is to be used to prove its derivation from it,
the same argument will hold for the Iambic, which first

1110 pre· Epic Hexameter of the early Hymns and partly
from the reaction of the ‘pre hexameter ’ folk-songs1
upon it. Archilochus, who, as we shall see, seems to hav e
‘ gone to the folk ' for some, at least, of his metres, com·
bines Iambic and Trochaic with ‘ Half-pentameters ’;
and it is on the face of it more likely that the Pentameter
is a conjunction of two wholes than that Archilochus
split it and used half at a time.

Now if the ἕλε-γος was originally a lament, as it still is
in Euripides' Helen, I phiqenia in Tauris, and Andromache,
and in Aristophanes’ Bircls, it is possible that the two
parts of the Pentameter were once sung by two semi-
choruses and the preceding Hexameter by a singer to the
fiute. The refrain of the ancient Elean Hymn to Dionysus
is doubled, and so is the cry ὦ ἴτε Βάκχαι 111 Euripides;
1110 Muses in 1110 Iliad lament Achilles ἀμειβόμεναι,

‘’alternately ; and an amoebeic Dirge is implied in
the Lament for Bion (48). Such an origin might account
for what is so strange in the Elegiac Distich in com-
parison with the frequently overlapping Epic Hexameter,
its unity. Of course, in the earliest Elegiacs‚ those of
Callinus and Archilochus, this non-overlapping rule is by
no means always observed3 moreover the second part
of the Pentameter is always Dactylic, while Spondees are
allowed in the first. But it is only our school-traim'ng
in the Ovidian Distich which emphasises the frequency
of these early ovet-laps rather than their infrequency3
and the Dactylic fixity of the second half may well be a
custom which came in after the combination of the two
parts had taken place3 for as we shall see, it was an
early tendency of Greek verse, as of Sanskrit‚ to keep
rules more carefully towards the end than towards the
beginning of the line, witness, among other things, the
comparative rareness even in Homer of a Spondaic fifth
foot. Moreover the double-long at the middle and end
points fairly clearly to original breaks in the sense, breaks
which it would naturally take far longer for change of
fashion to override than the break at the end of the
