SAPPHO AND ALCAEUS

the days of Chrysothemis and Philammon. For the
chorus in the ancient ritual of Apollo we have clear
evidence in the Paean in Homer, in Olen’s Hymn to
Eileithyia, in the local Delian partheneia mentioned in the
Homeric Hymn to the Deliam Apollo, and in the χοροί
sent to Delos as mentioned by Thucydides and the προσόδιον
of Eumelus for the Messenians.

The chorus had probably been connected with the
Pan-Dorian Apollo-festival of the Carneia in all
Dorian communities from time immemorial, but had
degenerated at Sparta into mere folk-ritual till the
second revival of music, that by Thaletas in the 7th
Century. If Terpander's earlier revival dealt with
Choral Melic, we do not know of it. We find Thaletas
credited, as we have seen, with the introduction of the
Cretic and Paeonio rhythms and with the composition
of song-dances for the choruses of the Three Ages at
the Gymnopaediae. Tyrtaeus wrote for the same
choruses, and also, as 1133 been said above, composed
Elegies for the flute. This brings 113 down to Alcman,
with whom we have fully dealt already.

The Aeolian tradition deriving from Terpander,
which supplied Sparta with a long line of poets
mostly Lesbian, produced before the end of this
wonderful 7th Century the two great Lesbian lyr-ists
SAPPHO and ALCAEUS. Among Alcaeus’ ten Books
probably only one was choral, the Hymns; among
Sappho's nine 1 we find one comprising Epithalamies,
and the contents of the others seem to have been
mainly monodic. ἡ

Besides this new predominance of solo-song, we find
new rhythms‚ some of which are familiar to us because
they were adopted and adapted by Horace. Besides
these distinctively Aeolic metres both poets used the
Hexameter—but showing peculiarities which may well 116
pre-Homeric—,2 and Sappho's eighth Book contained

. editions in Roman times see vol. i, p. 218 n. ² κέλομαι begins

one line of Alcaeus, and another ends with ρόος ἐς θάλ ααααααααααα
while Sappho used the Spondaic beginning 30 frequently 33 *to
give her name to that type of line
