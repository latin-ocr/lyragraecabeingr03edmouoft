Scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes Arqonazccica z The word
ἴουλος is used to mean the first growth of the hair of the
chin. Eratosthenes however, in the Hermes, makes it the
name of a spinning-song: ‘ The hireling spinning-woman on
the lofty gete-house sang pretty ἴουλοι as she made barley·
cakes.’ ² But according to Didymus this is incorrect‚ and the
ἴουλος is a hymn to Demeter like the Troezenian οὔπιγγος to
Artemis, It seems that οὖλος or ἴουλος is the sheaf and
Οὐλώ (Oulo) is a. name of Demeter.

semus in Athenaeus Doctors ach'mzer(see p. 494 above): Thus
both the corn and the hymns to the Goddess are called οὖλοι
or ἴουλοι from the inventions of Demeter. The same word
comes in the compounds δημήτρουλος (οὖλος of Demeter) and
κᾳλλίουλος (οὖλος beautiful) and also in the song:

A sheaf, a sheaf, send, send a great sheaf.3

But according to other authorities the word means a spinning-
song.

Plutarch Symposimn qf the Seven Wz'se Men z The argument
having interrupted the drinking, Thales waggishly observed
that Epimenides was quite right to be unwilling to annoy
other people by grinding and baking his own food like
Pittacus. ‘I heard my hostess,’ said he, ‘singing over the
millstone when I was at Eresus

Grind, mill, grind3
E'en Pittacus once ground with thee,
And he was king of a fair countree.'
