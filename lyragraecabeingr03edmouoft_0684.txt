THE DITHYRAMB

derived from the ‘leaders of the Dithyramb,’ and it is
therefore significant that question-and-answer should be
so marked a feature both of the Melie and non-Melie parts
of Attio Drama.

The theme of the old folk-Dithyramb seems to have
been the adventures of Dionysus; but its extension to
other heroes began early in its history at Sicyon, where
according to Herodotus the adventures (πάθεα) of Adrastus,
one of the Seven before Thebes, were celebrated with
trag-ic dances (τραγικοῖσι χοροῖσι), ‘ in which they honoured
Adrastus instead of Dionysus ’; and this is spoken of as
the immemorial custom of the city down to 580. At
Athens, as we shall see, the extension to other heroes came
later. whatever its origin, the Dithyramb seems to have
developed before the historical period into the song-dance
of the worshippers, of whom one personated the God and
the rest Satyrs or goat-men, to the sound of the flute
around the altar at Dionysus at the sacrifice of a bull,
the song probably from the first competitive and the bull’s
carcase the prize. At Delphi Dithyrambs to Dionysus
were performed in the three winter months, Paeans to
Apollo during the rest of the year. At Athens the per-
formance of the Dithyramb belonged traditionally to the
early spring and was connected with the Anthesteria, a
sort of Feast of All Souis. From very early times the
cult of Dionysus seems to have been associated with that
of Apollo at Delos; it is worth noting that Simonides'
Dithyrambs were preserved in the Delian temple archives.

The raising of this old ritual song-dance to the sphere
of art was connected by the ancients with the name of
the Lesbian Arion, who is said to have flourished at the
court of Periander of Corinth about 625 ; to have been a
pupil of Alcman3 and to have been victorious at the
Carneian Festival at Sparta. According to Suidas’
authority he ‘ invented the tragic style, was the first to
assemble a chorus (χορὸν στῆσαι), to sing a Dithyramb, to
give that name to the song of the chorus, and to introduce
Satyrs speaking in metre.' According to Aristotle, also,
the originator of the Dithyramb was Arion, ‘ the first
trainer of the Cyclic Chorus (κύκλιος χορός).’ In these
two passages we seem to have the beginnings, that is the
raising to art-status, and possibly the differentiation, of
the Dithyramb, of Tragedy, and of the Satyric Drama.
