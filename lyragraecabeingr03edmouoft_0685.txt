THE EARLIER DITHYRAMB

years before Arion, would seem to be to the folk-ritual.
But perhaps it is unsafe for us, though the ancients did it,
to draw a hard⁸ and fast line between tho ‘ folk ³-stago of
development and the stage of ‘ art? When we draw it,
at any rate, and it is often convenient to do so, let us
remember that changes of this sort generally come more
gradually than ‘their historians suppose; and that tho
classification ‘ folk ’ and ‘ art’ is, at bottom, unscientifio.
The distinction, for any particular place or time, depends
on circumstances, and the winding river of culture often
parts into more than two streams.

It should be noted that Archilochus was a poet and
speaks of himself as ‘leading ’ the Dithyramb, and
ὁ ἐξάρχων the Dithyrambic poet remained in name through—
out the classical period. The leader's part would naturally
fall to a man of superior powers, in this case doubtless
powers of reproducing and improvising song-dauco,
especially if, as it seems to have been, the performance
was a matter of question and answer; for it takes more
intelligence to put an impromptu question than to answer
it.

After Arion, the next great name in the history of the
Dithyramb is that of the Argive Lasus (see p. 638). The
Argive musicians seem to have been famous at the end of
the 7th Century, when Cleisthenes of Sicyon ejected them
to make room for native performers. When we are told
that Lasus was the first to make the Dithyramb com-
petitive we should probably understand this to mean com—
petitive as an art-form at Athens. He and Simonides,
with the early dramatists such as Choerilus, Phrynichus,
Chionides, and perhaps Thespis, were probably prime actors
in the art-movement which began under the Peisistratids
and continued under the democracy. All the various
types, the Dithyramb proper, its offshoots Tragedy and
the Satyr play, and later, Comedy‚ the child of the rustic
vintage and harvest rites associated with the reproductive
forces in nature and man, were performed at the Greater
Dionysia, some at other festivals. The first recorded
victory ‘ with a chorus of men,’ which probably means
in the Dithyramb, that of Hypodicus of Chalcis in 508,
is thought to mark the beginning of the intertribal com-
petitions which were intended to help in the welding of
the new democracy. Private citizens, acting in two
categorias, as boys and as men, now superseded the guilds
