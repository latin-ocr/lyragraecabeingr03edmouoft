THE ENCOMIUM

to drop its isostrophic arrangement; and the refrain, if
it occurS, is apt to occur capriciously. Tho instrument of
the public or Festal Paean was at first, as was to be
expected, the lyre‚ and later flute and lyre, or even,
notably in the Processional Paean, the flute alone. The
accompaniment of the Symposiac Paean, as we have seen,
was given by the flute.

The Paeans both Festa] and Symposiac were turned
10 secular use before the end of the 4th Century.
The Encomium or EULOGY was the result of a similar
but far earlier change.

Among its early ancestors we should doubtless reckon
the Homeric ⁶ renowns of men.’ Its connexion with the
feast—originally a sacrificial feast——shows that like all
ancient customs it was once part of a rite ; and just as the
narrative Epic seems to have budded off from the Hymn,
it may well be that the Eulogy was an offshoot of the
Symposiac Paean. But 1116 1161116 ‘ the song in the κῶμος ’
points to a more immediate derivation from the revel with
which the symposium ended. Indeed Pindar more than
once uses the word κῶμος 111 1116 561156 of ἐγκώμιον,
Apart from Homer, the earliest extant example is Alcaeus’
monodjc ἐπαίνησις, 65 1116 Lesbians seem 10 have called it,
130 1115 brother returned from the wars. The new triadic
fragment of Ibycus, if Eulogy it be, shows the type fully
developed as a form of Choral Melic‚ an elaborate secular
song-dance performed in honour of an individual at a
feast. Such a development could at first only be expected
under the conditions which produce court-poeta In the
hands of Simonides, at any rate, the Choral Eulogy
became established as one of the great types of Greek
Melic‚ We have a considerable fragment of a poem in
seven· line strophes addressed to the Thessalian prince
Scopas, which, beginning with the rhythm called Encomio·
logie, — vvvvvvvvvv —, is probably an Encomium.
In it the poet speaks up in his own person for the man
whose character is ‘not too good for human nature' s
daily food.’ Of the Eulogies of Bacchylides we have two
incomplete examples, one 10 Alexander son of Amyntas,
king of Macedon, and the other to Hiero of Syracuse
(Ox. Pap. 1361). Βο111 616 composed in short recurrent
strophes3 both begin with a reference to the βᾶρβιτος;
both refer to the symposia at which they were performed3
