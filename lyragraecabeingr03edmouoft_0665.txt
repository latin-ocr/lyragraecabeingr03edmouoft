THE PROSODION

and for Alcaeus’ H ymn to Apollo by Pausaniae. To judge
by the fragments which seem to come from Simonides'
Hymn, ιο Poseidon, the Hymn was later elaborated to
include myths of some length, in this case that of the
Argonauts. Towards the end of the Classical period we
hear of Hymns by Timotheus, one of which, at any rate,
was monodic. Long before this the Hymn, almost alone
of classical Choral Melie, had thrown off the dance. The
Hymns of Classical times were generally sung at a sacrifice,
by a chorus standing round the altar of the God. There is,
naturally, no trace of the Triad, and, again perhaps
naturally, there seems to have been no characteristic
rhythm. In post-classical times the Hymns were fre-
quently performed by children of both sexes. The early
ν parallel of Olen's Hymn, to Eileithyia suggests that this

’ may have been comsnon in the classical period. Bacchy-

lides calls Hymns παιδικοί, though the actual form of the
word is suspect.l

The PROCESSIONAL or Prosodion‚ of which we
have two lines of an early example composed by
Eumelus for a chorus of Messenians to sing at Delos,
seems to have been a sort of Hymn-in·motion sung

gs ‹tihe dancing chorus approached the temple of the
0 .

The author of the passage in the Theogony (68) describing
the progress of the Muses to Olympus, was doubtless‚ as
we have seen, familiar with the Prosodion (see p. 62 2).
Like the standing Hymn, it included a pe tition. Eumelus
speaks of himself as an innovator. The as cription of the
invention of this form to Clonas probably marks a later
resuscitation involving the supersession of the lyre-
accompaniment by that of the flute. The metre was at
first, as it 3661113, the Hexameter ; later the characteristic
rhythm was the Prosodiac ——vv-—vv—(—), probably
a folk-rhythm forerunner of the Anapaestic, as the ‘ Half-
hexameter ’ found in one of Sappho's Weddjng-Songs and
in proverbs may have been one of the ancestors of the
Hexameter. It is found in the Embaterion or Sowq of the
Battle-C'harqe of the Spartans sometimes ascribed to
Tyrtaeus. The revival of this rhythm for use in the
Prosodion was perhaps due to Clonas. Processionals

perhaps different, if indeed it is not a play on the two meanings
