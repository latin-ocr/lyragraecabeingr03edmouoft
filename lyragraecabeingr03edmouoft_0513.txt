FOLK-SONGS: INTRODUCTION

Thus both the corn and the hymns to the Goddess
are called οὖλοι or ἴουλοι from the inventions of
Demeter.' The same word comes in the compounds
δημήτρουλος 311(1 καλλιόυλος, and also in the song ‘ A
sheaf‚ a sheaf, send, send a great sheaf.' 1 But ac-
cording to other authorities the word means a
Spinning—song. Nursing-songs are called καταβαυ-
καλήσεις 01· Lullabies. There was also a song sung
to Erigone at the Swing-Feast, called the ἀλῆτις or
Wandering-song. Compare Aristotle in the Con-
stitution of Colophon: ‘ Theodorus himself came later
to a violent end. He seems to have been a luxurious
liver, to judge by his poetry, for even to this day
the women sing his songs over the swings.' The
Reaping-song is called Lityerses. And according to
Telecleides' Amplzz'ctyons there was a song of the
hired labourers who went out to the farms, and
others, as· Crates tells us in his Daring Deeds, of the
bathmen, and yet another, according to Aristophanes'
T hesmoplzoriazusae2 and Nicochares’ H eracles as Chorus-
Leader, of the women who winnow the corn. More-
over the tenders of cattle and sheep had a song, the
βουκολιασμός or Herding-song. The inventor of this
was a Sicilian oxherd called Diomus, who is men-
tioned in 1116 Halcyon and Odysseus Shipmrecked of
Epicharmus. The 50118 sung at deaths and in
mourning is called the ὀλοφυρμός 01¹ Wailing. The
501185 called ἴουλοι belong to Demeter and Perse-
phone. The song to Apollo is called the Phileliad
or Sun-loving‚ as is shown by Telesilla; and the
songs to Artemis are known as οὔπιγγοι. Α1 Α1116115
