Suidas Leoeicon: Corinna t—Daughter of Achelo-
odorus and Hippocrateia, of Thebes or of Tanagra3
pupil of Myrtis; [nicknamed Myia ‘Fly’ 3] a lyric
poetess. It is said that she was victorious five times
over Pindar. She wrote five Books, and Inscriptions,
and Lyric NomeS.

Plutarch Gloty of Athens: When Pindar was as
yet young, and prided himself overmuch on his
command of language, Corinna censured his ill-taste
because, though myths are the proper work of a
poet, and forms of words, turns of phrase, changes
of expression, tunes and rhythms mere embellish-
ments, his poems were nevertheless devoid of them.
Pindar took strong objection to her words and pro-
ceeded to compose the lyric which begins ε ‘ IsmenUS‚
or gold—distaffed Melia, or Cadmus, or the holy race
of the Sown, or the doughty might of Hei-acles, or
the cheerful worship of Dionysus . . .' 1 and showed
it Corinna. Whereupon she retorted, laughing, that
he should sow with the hand and not with the whole
sack. For Pindar had simply made mixed drinks of
his myths and then poured them into his song.
