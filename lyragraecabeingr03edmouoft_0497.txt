Aristoxenus Elements of Rhychm [the ⁴ three-beat ' cadence]
It may also occur in the Iambic-lmctyl,l the syllables con-
cerned being reversed as regards the Cretic with reference to
the beats.² The metrical basis will be the iambus, thus ε

there immortal meads of varied flowers take to
their embrace beside an umbrageous grove dancing·
throngs of dainty Bacchic maids.³

In this passage the first five feet, and later a group of
three, employ the cadence as has been described. Again z

whoso delights in good cheer and a dance—

But this type of verse does not employ the rhythm at all

frequently . . . (The Baccheic type, as it is called)⁴ varies
its rhythm 111 the line:

beloved darling of the Seasons, respite to man
from his labour 5—

Three such feet sometimes occur together:

The great God that is child of a pure mother
whom Cadmus once begot 111 rich and wealthy

Thebes ⁶—

The same cadence may occur in the Iambus, though with
less grace than in the Baccheus ; for the single beat is more

suitable to the trochaic measure than to the Iambus. For
instance, in the lines:

Hither, come hither, ye maids, make haste to the

front. Who can that maiden be? How gracefully
about her hangs—

the ‘ syzygy,’ or extra lengthening of a syllable, occurs at
intervals of three feet, so as to produce a kind of period.
