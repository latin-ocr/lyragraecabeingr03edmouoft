THE PAEAN

introduction of the Paean at Sparta was ascribed to
Thaletas, who was said to have brought it from Crete, when
summoned to stay the plague. The Cretan connexion
is also marked by the Homeric H ymn to the Pythian Apollo
(c. 600 B.C.). The rhythm of the oldest form of the
refrain, coupled with the name of the foot known as the
Great Paeon, points to the original metre having been com-
posed of groups of five long syllables. This is perhaps the
best way of scanning the ‘ Hymn ’ Ζεῦ πάντων ἀρχά ascribed
to Terpander. But the extant Paeans show no surviving
trace of this rhythm and but few traces of its sister the
ordinary Paean — νυν (or mm— )‚ both possible descendants
of an old stress-foot of five beats (see p. 627 above). It is
possibly not without significance that the ‘new—Lesbian ’
Melie shows the clearest traces of old stress—conditions‚
that Archilochus calls the Paean ‘ Lesbian‚’ that
the refrain bears a resemblance to the name of the
Paeonians, and that Orpheus' head was carried, in the
tale, by the Hebrus to the shores of Lesbos. The Paean
of public ritual accompanied all the sacrifices at Delphi
except those offered during the three mont-hs' winter-absence
of Apollo, when its place was taken by the Dithyramb. It
was sung by women at Delos, by youths at Thebes; at
the Spartan Gymnopaediae it was performed by naked
youths in honour of those who fell at Thyrea in 546.
From about the year 460, when the cult of Asclepius was
introduced at Athens, it became the eustom to sing
Paeans there, in which Asclepius was probably associated
with Apollo, on the eve of the Greater Dionysia. We have
fragments or mentions of Paeans by Stesichorus, Tynnichus,
Simonides, Pindar, Diagoras, Bacchylides, Sophocles,
Socrates, Ariphron, Timotheus 3 and a considerable number
belonging to the late 4th Century and after, some of them
complete, are preserved in inscriptions. The two ‘ hymns '
with musical notation found at Delphi, which are com-
posed in Paeons and Cretics, may possibly be Paeans.
That the later Paean did not always contain the refrain is
clear from the ancient controversy over Aristotle’s Ode to
Virtue (p. 410).

The Symposiac or Dinner-table Paean was the everyday
eounterpart of the festal Paean at private dinner-parties‚
at club-feasts, at the common table of certain Dorian
communities, and the like. References to it are found as
early as Alcman. Among the Athenians—and the customs
