TERPANDER

‘ If ever ' says Aelian1 ‘the Spartans required the aid
of the Muses on occasion of general sickness of body or
mind or any like public affliction, their custom was to
send for foreigners at the bidding of the Delphic oracle‚
to act as healers and purifiers. For insta-nce they sum-
moned Terpander, Thales [or Thaletas], Tyrtaeus, Nym-
phaeus of Cydonia, and Α10111511.’ Η515 111 71511- Century
Greece is the poet as medicine· man. This, doubtless his
original role, is reflected earlier by Homer’ sepithet‘ divine:
later by Simonides’ peace· -making between Hiero and
Theron and by Pindar’ 5 0011115515 to his patrous, always
by the attributes of Apollo. Apollo destroys the pre-
sumptuous, helps and heals in time of general need, 15
the God of prophecy, and the God of the 15715 and of
song. Moses stayed the plague. But this is by the way.

‘ The first establishment of music at Sparta ’ says
Plutarch 2 ‘ was due to Terpander.’ TERPANDER,
who fiourished in the middje of the 7th Century, is
variously described as an Antissaean or Methymn'aean
of Lesbos, and of Cyme in Aeolis. The last, we may
remember, was the birthplace of Hesiod’s father, and
according to some accounts Terpander was descended
from Hesiod. But his father’s name, DerdeneS, is*

hardly Greek.

According to Pindar,3 Terpander invented the barbitos
‘ at the feasts of the Lydians to vibrate in answer to the
sounds (ἀκονῶν, ἀκοῶν) of the low-pitched pectis? which

which the liiwer carried the air, both converging finally
on a single note (see p. 606, n.)‚ or to the tradition that
Terpander added the octave string to the lyre. That he
did so, if this is true, at the expense of the ‘ third ’ note
(that is our sixth) in the scale, which he removed, is sug-
gested by several considerations, for instance the statement
of Plutarch that the lyre had only seven strings down to
the time of Phrynjs (c. 450).4
Aelian’s list of the lyric poet-musicians who ‘ran ’
the official cult-music at Sparta in the latter half of
the 7th Century is incomplete. It may be supple·
