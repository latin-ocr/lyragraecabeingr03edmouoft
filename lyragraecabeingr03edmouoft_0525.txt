1 To Amm11s1

Athenaeus Βορέω-3 at Bianor: There were some musical
instrumeuts besides those of wind and string, producing
merely noise, for instance the κρέμβαλα or castanets. These
are mentioned by Dicaearchus in his Life in Graece, where he
says that certain instruments which made a piercing sound
when touched by the fingers were much used by women in
certain paits of Greece to accompany dance and song; and
he compares the Artemis· Song beginning:

My heart bids me uther a hymn that shall please
thee, O Artemis, if e' er before thou hast had delight
of a damsel all bright with gold, who clasheth
brazen- cheeked crembals in her hands.

Theodoret [‘ Ahaz made his son to pass through the fire '] ε
In certain cities I have seen fires lit once a year in the streets,
and people leaping over them, not only children but grown
men, and. even babes passed through the flame. It seemed
to be an averting or purifying rite.
