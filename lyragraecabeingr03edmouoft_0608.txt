THE DARK AGE

songs of Demodocus (od. 8. 73, 266, 499), though all are
apparently mere entertainment, the second, which alone
is concerned with the doings of the Gods, alone is accom-
panied by a dance. This theory 1s supported by the 1150
01ὕ υνμ ος by Homer m Odyssey 8. 429 for what 1s apparently
a purely secular song—a survival perhaps from the days
when all formal song was ritual, and the partition 01 the
Hymn had not yet taken place.

It 15 remarkable too that in the earliest or Mytho·
logical Period, the DARK Aen, to which we must
now turn back, the period of Orpheus, Thamyris,
and Amphion, we hear little 11 anything of any
poetical form but the Hymn. Yet to judge from
references in Homer, analogies from other peoples,
and the usages 01 the Greeks in later times, there no
doubt existed side by side with them Weddjng-
Songs and Laments, for instance, and Occupation-
Songs of spinners, weavers, grinders‚ rowers, and
the like. How far all these should be classed as
cult-songs it is difficult to say, and if not, where to
draw the line. Go back far enough, and in a sense
every human act is cult. The point here is that
the Hymn seems at this very early time to have
taken the first, perhaps the only, place in what we
should now 0311 professional circles. Why, is fairly
clear. It was the subject 01 religious competition.
And naturally, for these contests, so marked a
feature 01 Greek 1110 at all periods, were performed
in honour of a God or hero, and for such a contest
in 11111510 the hymn of pra-ise or incantation—once
of the ghost—is the obvious subject: The fact
that 01011’5 Delian Hymn to Eileithyia (p. 594, below)
was choral and the Homeri ¹c Hymns monodic, need
not trouble 115.

11 we may trust Pausanias’ account of the earliest
competitions at Delphi—and his account almost certainly
represents the local tradition if not the local 1000165-
the early Hymns were sometimes, at any rate, sung and
played by a single person. The truth is, the clear-cut
line between choral and monodic song (or song-dauco)
was drawn comparatively late. Homer‘s minstrels already
