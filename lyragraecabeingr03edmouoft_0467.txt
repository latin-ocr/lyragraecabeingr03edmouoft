Theodorus the Metochite Prelwle [whether those who take
thought for the life according to virtue should marry or no]:
And poets, too, say

O sweetest Peace ’chat givest wealth to men

The Same [that practically everyone is the slave of the
love of wealth]: And even if they pretend to disregard and
overlook and pass by on the other side,

still are they pricked by Pleasure’s wiles

as the poem says.

Plutarch The Pythian Oracle: Dwellers near the Galaxium
(the shrine of Apollo) in Boeotia are warned of the God’s
epiphany by the great abundance of milk ;

For like purest water from the springs the welling
milk gushed forth from all the flocks, while they
filled their vessels in hot haste3 aye, neither skin
nor keg was idle in their houses3 piggin and
earthen jar, all were filled to the brim.
