BACCHYLIDES

few l{ragmentffi these last four Books are all of Pindar that
we ave.

With no complete Epinicion of Simonides to which
we may compare Pindar’s, we cannot tell how far the
structure of his odes or his treatment of the mythl
were new. But the outward and Visible informality
which embodies an inward and spiritual symmetry3
the seemingly casual, yet never, we may believe,
really abrupt, transitions which give to these works
of consummate art the easy flow of an evening’s
intimate conversation; the light and landscape
that is born of a single epithet ; the Vivid portrayal
of action as by a painter whose strokes are firm and
few; the dark metaphor doubtless made plain by the
gestures of the clancers3 the effect of playing with
a story rather than telling it; the combining of a
sublime detacthent oi outlook with the sympathy
of one acquainted with grief—it is part of the Greece
of that day that such things should be in a song of
congratulation to an athlete, but some at least of
them we may believe are Pindar’s own.

Till a generation ago Pindar’s Epinjcian Odes were
the only complete examples we possessed of Greek
Choral Melic outside the Drama. In 1896 the sands
of Egypt gave us part of a papyrus-roll containing
a number of Epinicia and Dithyrambs of his younger
contemporary, the last of the Great Nine. BACCHY-
LinEs, like his mother’s brother Simonides, was a
native of Iulis in Ceos, where he was born about 510.

Like Pindar he seems to have visited the houses of his
patrons in various cities of Greece3 he was apparently
with his uncle at the court of Hiero at Syracuse3 he
spent part of his life in exile—probably for anti-democratic
tendencies——in the Peloponnese; his first datable ode
was written about 485, his latest in 452. A comparison
of his ‘ output ’ with that of Simonides and Pindar indicates
a similarity throughout3 but we find no Dirges‚ and we
do find Love-Songs. If the two elder poets wrote Erotica,
they were included in their Euloqies. To Bacchylides, like
