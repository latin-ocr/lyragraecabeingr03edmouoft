CLEOMENES, LAMYNTHIUS, GNESIPPUS

And the author of the comedy called The Helots says ε

It is old-fashioned to sing Stesichorus, or Alcman, or
Simonides. We can listen to Goesippus, who has invented
songs for lovers to eall out their mistresses with, icmbyce}1
and three-cornered lute in hand.

Compare the Sqft-Livers of Cratinus ε

Pray who has ever seen me in love, Gnesippus? (and the
answer is) Not 13 far from it; I really think I have never
seen such an empty-headed fool.

And the same poet gibes thus at Gnesippus' poems in The
Neatherds:

. . . who refused Sophocles a chorus when he gave one
to the son of Cleomachus, whom I wouldn’t have train a
chorus of mine even for the feast of Adonis.

Again, in the Seasons:

And after him may go the son of Cleomachus, that trainer
sor tragedy who has a chorus of hair-removing-maids removiny
bad songs in the Lydian mode.

And according to the St‘ff 'Um of Teleeleides he led a life
of profligacy. ·

The Same: I had almost forgotten to mention to you the
Lyde of Antimachus, and moreover her namesake the
courtesan beloved by Lamynthius of Miletus. According to
the Erotics of Clearchus each of these poets, falling in love
with a soreigner called Lyde, composed a poem which he
named after her, the former an elegiae, the latter a lyric.
