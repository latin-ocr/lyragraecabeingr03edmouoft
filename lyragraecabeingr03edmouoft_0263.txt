LEOTRO PH 1 DES

on LEOTRO PH I DES

Scholiasts on Aristophanes1: (a) Because Leotrophides
like Cinesias, was very thin3 or because he too was a ‘light '
(that is, worthless) writer of dith) rambs . . Leotrophides
belonged to this tiibe. But some authorities say that the
allusion is to his lightness and thinness‚ resembling those of
a bi1d. Compare Theopompus m the Shop· Girls:

Leotrophides t-he three· pounder will seem to Leontius as
fair· ·complexioned and lovely as a eorpse.2

(b) Because Leotrophides‚ like Cinesias, was remarkably
thiu. Compaie Hermippus T Ιιε Uen- llon'lczeys

The poor are alreadye waciificing to >ou wretched tinee-
legged beasts as thin as Leotrophides or Thumant-is. ³
