PRELUDE AND NOME

as it were signed his name‚1 against the conservatism 01 1116
now dominant Spartans in matters 01 11111310 and poem-y.
We may well believe that this justification 01 1116 poet to
his judges in the competition would have been unnecessary
had they been Athenians. Degeneration had gone
further at Athens than at Sparta.

There seem to have been extant at this time certain
Lyre-Sung Nomes ascribed to Terpander. These probably
are the ten ἀοιδαί mentioned by Timotheus. The
derivation 01 νόμος 111 11113 connexion is not quite certain.
This use 01 1116 word is first found in the Hymn to the
Delion Apollo. The ancient explanation that it meant

‘’regular because the composer was not allowed to go
bey ond the proper technical limits will not hold water;
101· 1116 frequent change 01 mode and rhythm (in the same
song) with which this explanation would contrast it, was,
as we know from Plato, a late development. Now the
Nomes 01 Terpander were coupled with, but different
110111, 1113 προοίμια or Preludes; it is clear from Suidas
that these were preludes to the Nomes; and when Plutarch
wants to prove his derivation 01 νόμος 116 says z ‘ As soon
as the performer had done his duty by the Gods, he passed
on to the poetry 01 Homer and other poets—-which is
proved by the Preludes 01 Terpander.' This would seem
to imply that Terpander’s Preludes, like some 01 the
H omerio H ymns, contained some reference to their having
originally been followed by Epic Lays. Was it the
custom that Prelude should be followed by Nome and
Nome by Epic Lay?

Before it means law νόμος means custom. It is
conceivable therefore that νόμος 111 11113 connexion means
the usual, 11 not the legally constituted, song, the pre-
scribed part, the ritual and once unvaried part, 01 1116
performance3 2 and thus first, when the Hymn broke in
two and the Epic became a separate thing, the alternative
terms νόμος and προοίμιον (31111 sometimes called ὕμνος)
were left standing alone without the Lay the contrast with
which had given them birth3 the second stage was the
div yiding 01 the νόμος into the προοίμ ον νόμου and

1 W il. compares the end 01 1116 Hymn to the Delian Apollo

².cf the ἐκ των όμων ᾠδαί taught to the young Cretam,
Stra-b. 10. 4. 20, and the use ofv νόμος-εν μόισμα, whence Latin
nummu8; the use of the word by Alcman fr. 70 of the songs of
birds may well be a metaphor from the Flute- Nome itself
