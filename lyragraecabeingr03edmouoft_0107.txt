BACCHYLIDES

for Gods the yellow flame of the burning of the
thighs of oxen and fleecy sheep upon fine-wrought
altars, and for the young a desire for disport of
bodyl and for flute and festal dance. Meanwhile in
the iron-bound shield-thong hang 'che warps of the
brown spider, headed spear and two-edged sword are
whelmed in an ever-spreading rust, and the noise of
the brazen trumpet is not3 nor is rest from our
eyelids that honey-hearted sleep which soothes ’che
spirit towards dawn.2 The streets are abloom with
delightful feasting and the hymns of children go up
like a flame.
