THE DRINKING-SONG

been said above, to have used the song as a letter. Most
of Anacreon’s songs of satire, of love and wine, of regret
for past youth, are clearly Melie and Monodic Table·Songs
or Iambic (or Trochaic) recitations to the lyre. Even in the
court-poet the political motif is not always absent.

Lesbian infiuence is clear too in the book of Attio
Scolia, whose preservation we owe to Athenaeus. Here
we find political or national songs referring to the struggles
of the nobles against the Peisistratids‚ celebrating the
tyrannicideS, recalling the Persian Wars ; songs lauding
Athena, Demeter and Persephcme, Apollo ancl Artemis,
Pan3 or gnomic (moralising) songs on friendship and good
company—all these in the characteristic four—line ⁴ hendeca-
syllabic ’ stanza; an ‘ Alcaie ' strophe on the theme ‘ Look
before you leap,’ and a partly Glyconic fable of the Grab
and the Snake, both perhaps from Alcaeus; and a number
of couplets mostly gnomic in subject and in Choriambic
metres, some taken from Praxilla. The book perhaps
included the distrophic War-Sonq of Hybrias the Cretan.
With the exception of this last and Callistratus’ H armodius-
Sonq, which has four isorrhythmic strophes, they are all
of but one stanza. The repetitions in the Harmodius-
Sony (ll. 1—2 = ll. 9—10, ll. 3-4 z ll. 15-16) are probably a
characteristic feature, to be connected in the history of
folk-song with the competitive ‘ capping ’ in certain forms
of Bucolic poetry. Compare the quotation-capping
scene between Bdelycleon and Philocleon in the Kniqhts.

There is no doubt that improvisation took part in
the creation of many of these Drinking-Songs. A change
in the fashion of these things is indicated by a passage
which is also valuable as showing us how these songs were
sung at Athens, Aristophanes Olouds 1353 ff„ which is here
given in Rogers’ translation ε

Strepsiades. Well from the very first I will the whole contention ’

show :

’Twas when Ι went into the house to feast him, as you know,

Ι bade him bring his lyre and sing, the supper to adorn,

Some lay of old Simonides, as, how the Ram was shorn:

But he replied‚ to sing at meals was coarse and obsoleto ;

Like some old beldame humming airs the while she grinds the
wheat.
