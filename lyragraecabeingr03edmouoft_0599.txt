AN ACCOUNT
OF GREEK LYRIC POETRY

ΟΝ the third day of the Apaturia, known as
Children’s Day, when Athenian fathers brought the
infants born within the year to be enrolled in the
clan, it was the custom, according to Plato, for the
schoolchildren to compete for prizes in the singing
and recitation of passages from the poets. The
young Cretans, according to Ephorus, were taught
to sing the songs prescribed by law, including, no
doubt, the &Var-Song of Hybrias. At Sparta the
survival of the Spartan war-poems of Tyrtaeus may
be due merely to their use as exhortations to battle,
but the traditional kinship of the Cretan and Laconian
codes suggests that they were also taught to the
boys. The Arcadians, in Polybius' time, taught the
children first to sing the Hymns and Paeans cele-
brat-ing the Gods and heroes of their city, and as
they grew older the Nomes of Philoxenus and Timo·
theus. At Chios an inscription of the Qud Century
ΒΩ. mentions among school—subjects reading, recita-
tion, and lyre-playing. We learn much the same
of Teos from an inscription of the 3rd Century.1
Take it as a whole, Greek education, so neglectful,
as it seems to US, of languages, was far from neglectful
of language‚ and taught it in an excellent way, by
imitation, vit-ct voce, of good modeIS. The children
of the Athenians, at any rate, grew up able to appre-
ciate the masterpieces of literature, witness the mere
size of the Dionysiac Theatre. And not only this.
Even as children the young Greeks took part from
time immemorial in festal song and dance, and every
Athenian tribe as constituted by Cleisthenes pro-
duced large choruses of unprofessional singers, men
and boys, at the annual festivals of Dionysus. When
the young Athenian, and we may believe the same
of other Greeks, took his place as a man in the

1 the Athenian schoolmaster's library would include such
anthologies as the Attio Scolia and ‘ Theognis ’
