MELANIPPI DES

THE POEMS OF MELANIPPIDES
1

Athenaeus Doctors αι Dinner [on dates]: Melanippides of
Melos, in the Danazds, calls the fruit of the palm dates, where
he describes those maidens thus:

For they wore not the shapely form of men, nor
yet had they the voice of women, but did strenuously
in seated chariots all about the sunny1 woodlands,
ofttimes rejoicing their heart in the chase, ofttimes
seeking the frankincense’ holy tear and the sweet-
scented date or the smooth Syrian grains of ’che
cassw..

2 MARSYAS

The Same: On the subject of flutes one of the guests
observed that} Melanippides in his Marsyas had rightly dis-
paraged sinte-playing in speaking of Athena thus :

Athena cast those instruments of music from her
sacred hand and said, ζ Away with you, ye shameful
things, defilers of the body3 I give not myself to

my own undoing.' 2

¹ the point is that they were not, like most Greek women,
unwilling to expose themselves to the sun 2 cf. Telestes
