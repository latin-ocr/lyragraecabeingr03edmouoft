ADONIS-SONGS : WEDDING-SONGS

of the classical period—became art-song in the hands
of Alcman 1 and Sappho.

As we have seen, the ⁴ Sapphic ’ stanza probably owes
something to the people’s Adonis-Song; and there are
several fragments of Sappho which clearly come from
her Adonideia, of the composition of which she seems to
speak in a new and doubtfully restored fragment. One
of these fragments, which is in a Choriambic metre,
belongs to an Amoebeic song between a chorus of maidens
and their leader who personates Cytherea—an interesting
parallel to the early Dithyramb, itself the work of a
Lesbian, Arion. Adonideia are also ascribed to the Dorian
poetess Praxilla of Sicyon. In the Alexandrian period,
when women's natural position in civilised life comes
again to be reflected in the treatment of love in literature,
we have Bion's hexameter Lament for Adonis and Theo-
critus’ book-representation of the song sung on the previous
day of the festival to celebrate the marriage of Adonis and
Aphrodite.2

The same period saw a revival of the Epithalamium. The
hymeneal folk-songs, of which the refrain was ὦ ὑμὴν ὑμέναιε
or the like, were apparently of several classes: the song
of the marriage sacrifice and feast, the song of the wedding-
procession,³ the songs at the door of the bridal chamber
before and after the nuptial night3 but some of these

dance. Theocritus' Epithalamy of Helen, which we are
told owed something to the Helen of Stesichorus, and
seems to show an acquaintance with the ixth Book of
Sappho, is supposed to be danced by maidens before the
chamber during the night. Sappho's 65th fragment ends
with a reference to the coming dawn. The Helen of
Theocritus begins with banter of the bridegroom, quickly
pasees to praise of the bride’s beauty and her skill as
spinner and weaver and as player of the lyre——this makes

² the Adonis-Song is not quite certain for Alcman, but we
know that he mentioned a Phrygian fluteplayer called Adon,
who perhaps took his name from the God he personated
² xv. 100 ff.; the song itself contains (137 ff.) a forecast of the
dirge to be sung on the morrow ³ if the Harmatian Flute-
Nome ascribed to Olympus means Chariot-Tune, it may well
belong here; cf. Didymus ap. Sch. Eur. Or. 1384 and the
Epitymbidian Nome
