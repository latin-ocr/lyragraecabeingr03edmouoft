ELEGY

older than Eumelus3 101 111 it Dionysus is 3 bull-
God or rather a bull-hero,1 and there is no mention
01 wine. Met-rically it seems to go back, like some
01 the Half-hexameter proverbs, to pre-hexameter
days, from the same stock indeed as the Epic, but

a remote cousin.

But the joint reign 01 the Epic and the lyre—a
reign long afterwards still remembered in the sub-
conscious mind 01 1113 Greek race, 101 κρούματα,
literally ‘strikingsj and πολύχορδος, literally ‘of
many strings,' were used in 01355103] times of flute
as well as 01 lyre——was coming to an end. As we
enter the 7th Century, we find new kinds 01 pro-
fessional poetry, new kinds which, though they may
not in their extant state have so long a past behind
them as the Hexameter, must nevertheless not be
regarded as new creations. The lore 01 the unskilled‚
unlearned, unrecognised, has merely begun one 01
115 1330110115 011 1113 1013 01 1113 skilled, the learned,
the fashionable.2 Let us begin with the ELEGY.
The ancient view was that it originated in a lament.
This 15 very likely true. The non-Hellenic word

Β.0.) 1135 been compared with the Armenian εῑὲρη ·

‘ reed ’ or ‘ flute ² 3 Armenian is the modern repre-
sentative 01 ancient Phrygian; the instrument 01
Elegy was the flute3 the flute was believed by the
Greeks to have 001113110111 Phrygia3 the flute seems
10 have been connected with the worship 01 Cybele
as the lyre with that 01 Apollo.

At first sight the fact that the Pentameter, which is
certainly misnamed, enters history in association with
the Hexameter‚ 15 3 strong indication that it developed
out 01 it. Yet not only does it appear as early as Stesi-
chorus (0. 600 B. C. ) in conjunction with a Dactylic Hepta-

meter, but in Archilochus (0. 650) we find‘ half· -penta-
meters’ mixed with Iambic and Trochaic metres; and 111

inscriptions a Pentameter sometimes ends a succession 01
Hexameters. Moreov er 11 115 early association with the
