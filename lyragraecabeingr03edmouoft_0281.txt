LIFE OF CINESIAS

for their periodic revel one of the forbidden days
of the calendar, under the name not of the
New-Moon Club but the Devil's Own ?—a name
suitable, as it turns out, to the mernbers' fortunes,
but chosen doubtless not so much with that in-
tent as to 1111011· ridicule both upon the Gods
and upon the law of their country. His colleagues
ended as such folk often do. The best-known
member of the club has been so visited by Heaven
that his enemies do not wish him dead but hope
that he may live long as 311 example, so that others
may realise that irreligion is punished not in 1113
children but in the fathers, for that these are
visited with greater and severer calamities both
in body and estate than all the rest of mankind
put together. To be sick or to die of ordinary
ills is the common lot of man, but to continue
thus year in year out, to be dying day by day
and yet be unable to make an end, is 3 fate
deserved only by the committers of such sins 35
1113 defendant's.' Such is the orator's description
of Cinesias.
