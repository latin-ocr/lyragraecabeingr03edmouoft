Herodian On Peczcliarz‘cies: ὀψέ ‘late ’2 . . . The Aeolians,
however, use the form in ι even when it is not compounded ;
compare

for he began too late3

which i} more consistent, as is shown in the tract On
Adi-erbs!

Cramer Inedita (Oxford) [on the word ἅψεα 111 the
Odysseyk The letter υ is never used before a double letter
except in ὕψος . . . where the Aeolians are more consistent
in using the form ἵψος

height
and Υψηλος ‘high ' ; compare

down the high hills

The Same: The word ὃρῶ ‘ to see’ is clearly of the second
conjugation, but we see that it is also of the first if we
compare the Aeolio dialect ; for as the participle of οἰκῶ ‘ to
dwell’ is οἵκεις (Α10. 88), so that of ὁρῶ ‘to see' is ὅρεις·

but O thou all-surveying Sun 4

The Same: ἱδρώς ‘sweat'3 this is used as a feminine in
Aeolic; it takes the declension of feminine nouus . . . such
as ἠώς ‘ dawn‚' and then the genitive {Speos—compare

as ill-smelling as sweat

—instead of ἱδροῦς; as in ‘Melanchrus worbhy of respect'
(Alc. 47), αἴδως for αἰδοῦς.
