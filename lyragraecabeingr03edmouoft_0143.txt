lee first part os this Ode seems to hare contained αη invocation
to the illusos and an address to Corinth as the seat os the Isthmian
Festiral, and passed on to the story of Minos ancl Deaez'tlzca, a
story which is preserved as follows .·—-(a) Pindar Pcoecms [on
Dexithea]: Euxantius told them the marvel that once befel
him t—‘ Surely I fear war with Zeus and the lond-thundering
Earth-Shaker. Surely their levin-holt and trident sent a
land and its people every man into deep Tartarus, all but my
mother and her well-walled house '—(b) Callimachus Oriyz'ns ε
And therewithal insolence and a lightning-death, and likewise
the wizards the Telchins and Demonax who so foolishly
flouted the blessed Gods—these the old man³ did put in his
writing-tablets, and aged Macelo mother of Dexithea, them
twain that alone the Immortals left unharmed when they
overturned an island for its sinful insolence. (c) Scholiast on
the Ibis: It is said that Macelo and her sisters were
daughters of Damon, and that Jupiter having enjoyed their
hospitality saved them4 when hc struck the Telchins, of
whom Damon was chief, by lightning for maliciously blight-
ing all the fruits of the earth. To these daughters came
Minos, and was united with Dexione, and begat Euxantius
father of the Euxantidae. Compare also (d) Nonnus Dionysiaca :
Macello entertained Zeus and Apollo at one [board] 3 and (e)
Tzetzes Theoyony: From the blood which dripped from the
mutilated Uranus and entered the earth sprang first the
three Furies Tisiphone, Megaera, and Alecto, and with
them the four famous Telchins, Actaeus, Megalesius,
Ormenus, and Lycus, whom Bacchylides calls Sons of
ISqemesis and Tartarus but some authorities of Earth and

ea.
