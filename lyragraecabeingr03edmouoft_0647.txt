TH E TWO LESBIA NS

lament, the written love-poem to the serenade, as thc
written message is to direct speech.

Even in Archilochus there are fragments which might
come from letters; Alcaeus writes from exile to his friend
Melanippus; Sappho's so-called Hymn to Aphrodite may
be best interpreted as a love-letter3 her scolding Ode to
the Nereide could hardly have been sung to Charaxus
with lyre-accompaniment3 we may well believe that
Horace, in imitat-ing the style and matter of the Lesbian
poetry, imitated also its occasions, and some of his Odes
are unmistakably letters, for instance Ι. 20, an answer to
Maecenas' request for an invitation to the Sabine farm.
Moreover in a new fragment of Sappho there is some trace
of the poem of reflexion, in which the audience, as it were,
is the writer himself.

These uses of poetry indicate again an increase of
individualism and sels-consciousness.

Among the remains of Alcaeus, besides the songs
mentioned above, we find Hymns and VVar-Songs.
All his forms, except the HymnS‚ were probably
developments of the songs sung either at feasts or
after the company had broken up and lovers sought
their mistresses. Many were doubtless sung at table,
some outside the loved one’s door,——and some, as
we have seen, were sent as letters. These occasions,
we may take it, were not confined to men. W omen
were not kept in the background in Lesbos, or Sappho
would not have had sufficient political influence to
deserve banishment. Indeed the evidence goes to
show that the seclusion of high-born women in
Greece was Ionian rather than Dorian or Aeolian.
Even at Athens, to judge by certain of Aristophanes’
comedies, it was probably not so complete as is
generally believed.

This is not the place to attempt an estimate of the
influence exercised by these two Lesbians, direct or
through their imitatore, on the culture of the western
world. We know what Dionysius thought of Alcaeus,
what Plato thought of Sappho. To many moderns,
Sappho, like Plato himself, is one of those great of
the earth to whom one returns again and again to
