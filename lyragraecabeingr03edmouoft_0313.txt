TIMOTHEUS

Aristotle DIelaphysics: If there had been no
Timotheus, much of our lyric poetry would have been
lost to us, and if there had been no Phrynis there
would have been no Timotheus.

THE POEMS OF TIMOTHEUS

Boon I
HYMNS
1-2 To ARTEMIS

Macrobius Saturnalia: The famous poet Alexander of
Aetolia, in the book entitled The Mases, tells of the enthusiasm
shown by the people of Ephesus at the dedication of their
temple of Diana, prizes being offered to induce the greatest
poets of the day to compose various songs in honour of the
Goddess.¹ In Alexander’s lines Opis is the name not of the
Goddess‘s companion‚ but of the Goddess herself. He is
speaking, as I said, of the people of Ephesus : ‘But hearing
that all Greece honoured Timotheus for his skill with the
lyre and its songs, they bade Thersander's son for a hundred
of golden shekels to hymn the sacred millennium ² and with
it Opis the hurler of swift shafts who hath her sumptuous
house on Cenchreus’ bank’; and later he says ⁶ nor leave.
unsung the works of Leto’s Goddess-daughter.’

¹ as the older temple was not destroyed till 356 B.C.
and T. died at least a year earlier, the connexion of this hymn
with the dedication of the new temple must be a mistake
² ms. reading doubtful
