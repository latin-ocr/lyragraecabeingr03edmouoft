Lm:

—Soc. There‘s another thing you ought to leam
about proper names, and that is to distinguish
masculine from feminine. —STR. But I know which
are feminine, trust me. —Soo XV ell?— STR. Lysilla,
Philinna, Cleitagora, Demetria (684). —.Soc And
masculine names 0?—'ST1³. Thele's thousands3 Phil-
oxenus, Melesias, Amynias (686).—Soc. But they're
not masculine, you bad boy.—STR. Not masculine
enough P—Soc. Not a bit maseuline3 how would
you call Amynias if you saw him ?——STR. Call him?
why, like this3 Hi, Amynia! (691).—Soc. D’ye
see? That’s a woman's name.2—STR. Quite right
too 3 she won't join up.

Scholiast on the passage: (684) These were harlots.
—-(686) These are satirised for effeminacy.3—(69l)
The poet satirises the man by playing with the
ending of the name.

The Same Frogs: D1om·sns and Azscnx‘LUs 1——Yes,
by the Gods; I’ve lain awake many a long hour of
the night trying to make out what sort of bird the
tawny horse-cock was—A. It was a ship’s figure-
head, you silly dolt.—-D. thy, I thought it was
Eryxis son of Philoxenus.

masculine names is³ identical with the corresponding nomina·
ti've feminine ³.cf Ar. Vesp. 81 and Seh.
