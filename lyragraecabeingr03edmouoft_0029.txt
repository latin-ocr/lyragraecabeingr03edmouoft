CORINNA

But I, I am come to sing the prowess of Heroes
and Heroines, in fair old—wives' tales for the white-
robed daughters of Tanagra3 and greatly doth their
city rejoice in my clear sweet babbling cries.1

Pausanias Descrz'ptz'on of Graece : They say that one day
when an Eretrian fleet put in on the coast of the territory of
Tanagra, Hermes the Champion led the ephebi or youngest
men into the field and by employing a strigil or flesh—seraper

ephebus-like as a weapon, infiieted a severe defeat on the
enemy.

Apollonius Pronomzs [on the pronoun ‘ me ’] ε Indeed along
with ἐμοῦς ‘ of n1e' there goes a form τεοῦς ‘of thee' . . .
Compare also Corinna :

For thy sake2 Hermes fights 3 Ares with his fists.

Cramer [aedita (Oaeford) [on the preposition ἐς ‘int-o']:
This form of the preposition is identieal with another, the
Boeotian form for ἐξ ‘out of '; compare

out of the Muses

but in that dialect if the preposition precedes a vowel it
takes the form ἐσσ ; compare

beginneth warfare

certainly belong here ² Tanagra’s ³ in this poem
⁸ 1, 3, 4 would doubtless be taken (by a grammarian or
metrieian) from an early-placed poem ; 1—3 could belong to

the ἀρχή or σφραγίς, and 4-10 to the ὀμφαλός of a poem
describing the battle (E)
