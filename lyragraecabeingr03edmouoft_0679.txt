THE DIRGE

Linus, both having their echoes in Attic drama, tho former
for instance in Aeschylus Supplices 113 ff. and Euripides
Phoenissae 1034 ff„ and the latter in Aeschylus Aqamemnon
121 ff, Sophocles Ajaae 626. The traditional metre of
the Ἰᾶιλεμος was perhaps vvvvvvvv l —v„ —————
for this rhythm occurs in both the above passages and
corresponds in part with the word itself, doubtless once a
refrain. The Linus refrain was Dactylic, αἴλινον ammom
which is derived from the Semitic and once meant ‘ woe
for us Ξ ’ Both these forms were said to have come from
Asia, and both refrains, being non-Hellenic and therefore
unintelligible, gave rise to myths in which Ialemus and
Linus were persons. The Linus-Song in Homer has been
already dealt with on p. 586. There was some confusion
in the later antiquity between the Θρῆνος and the
Ἐπικήδειον. The Epikedeion was perhaps once an alter-
native term which came later to be used for the Elegiae
Lament in particulam the adjective ἐπικήδειος occurs
first in Euripides. As with so many other forms of
Melic poetry, we have indications of the use of Hexa-
meters in the first art-stage. We may compare Euripides
Andromache 103 ff„ where an Elegiae Lament by Andro-
mache herself is followed by a Choral Ode in which the
Hexameter is mixed with ‘ Half-pentameters’ as well as
with Iambic and Trochaic lines reminiscent of the Ialemus.
Compare also the H elen 164 ff. The Elegy of Andromache
is doubtless closely akin both to the ‘ Epigram ’ 01· Inscrip-
tion commemorative of the dead, and to the Ἐπιτάφιος
Λόγος or Public Funeral Oration delivered over fallen
warriors at Athens at least as early as the beginning of the
5th Century. Bion's Lament for Adonis is entitled ἐπιτάφιος ;
here we find the amoebeic and refrain elements of the old
popular Dirge, of which the former survived in the κομμοὶ
of Attic drama.

In art-poetry, with the possible exception of Stesichorus,
the Dirge appears first among the works of Simonides,
where, perhaps under the influence of the Eulogy, it seems
to have thrown off. the refrain.1 The Dirqe sor These who
fell at Thermopylae was probably sung and danccd over
their grave. If complete, it is a single strophe of ten
lines. The Danae, if it is a Dirge, was a more elaborate
work in two or more Triads of 25 or 30 lines, containing
a myth. Simonides seems to have raised the Dirge, as
