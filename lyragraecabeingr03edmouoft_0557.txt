GAME-SONGS

Pot turns and catehes one of the others, the player who is
caught takes his place. Sometimes the chief player holds on
to the edge of the pot with his left hand while he runs round
in a circle, and the rest strike him, asking

Who watches the pot ? 1
and he replies
The pot’s a-boiling3
or else they say
Who's round the pot?
and he replies

I, Midas,2

and whoever he reaches with his foot takes his place.³

Hesy'rchius Glossary 35

a game played at Tarentum.

Plutarch Lffe of Theseus [the Cretan tributeJ: Moreover
Aristotle himself in his Conscientiam of Bottiaea clearly does
not hold that these children (of the Athenians) were put to
death by Minos, but that they lived the remainder of
their lives as slaves in Crete; and he declares that the
Cretans once sent human firstlings to Delphi in fulfilment of
an ancient vow, and among them descendants of these
Athenian children who, being unable to support themselves
there, first crossed over into Italy and settled in the district
of Iapygia, and thence passed into Thrace, where they came
to be called Bottiaeans3 which is the reason why the
Bottiaean maidens sing as they perform a certain sacrifice

Off to Athens we will go.4

‘ Off to Athens’ etc.) ‘. . . Hence the daughters of the
Bottiaeans commemorate their descent- by singing at their
festivals “ Off to Athens ’¹ etc.’
