Pollux Onomasticon: Songs to the Gods are called
in general paeans or hymns, in particular a hymn to
Artemis is known as οὔπιγγος, to Apollo as the
paean. Both these are addressed in processional
songs, Dionysus in the dsthyramb, Demeter in the
ἴουλος. The Linus and Lityerses are the songs of
delvers and husbandmen.

ing to them the women go begging gifts for them,
calling upon their names in the hymn composed for
them by a Lycian named Olen . . . This Olen it
was who came from Lycia and composed this and
the other ancient hymns that are sung at Delos.

song of the Lycian ancient, the song the prophet
Olen brought from the bank of Xanthus, and the
maidens that dance to them beat with their feet the
stable earth.
