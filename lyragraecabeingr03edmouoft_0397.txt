LIFE OF PHILOXENUS OF CYTHERA

And in another part he says :

PhiloxenuS‚ they say, he of Cythera

Wished that his throat had been three cubits
To mlfflg'hig drinking last as long 's could be

And all his victuals give him equal joy.

And Diogenes the Cynic died of an over-loaded
stomach1 from eating a cuttle-fish raw. Of
Philoxenus Sopater the parodist writes as follows :

For in between two feasts of fish he sits
And gazes straight into the side of Etna.2

Polybius Histories: It is a matter of common
knowledge that the Arcadian system is almost
unique. In Arcadia the children are by law taught
first to sing the hymns and paeans with which each
community according to its custom honours the
heroes and Gods. Later they learn the ‘nomes'
of Philoxenus and Timotheus and dance them in
keen competition every year for the Dionysiae flute-
players in the theatres, the boys compe'ting in the
children's contests and the young men in what are
called the men’s contests. Nay, in like manner at
all times when they dine together they rather call
upon each member of the company for his song than
employ professional musicians to entertain them.
