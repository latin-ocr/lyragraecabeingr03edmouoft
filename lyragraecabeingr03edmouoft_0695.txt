THE END

were the exception no harm was done, but when they
became the rule, the words became less important
than the music because less easily intelligible to the
ear, poetry was less often sung for its own sake, and
even Monodic art-song eventually appealed to few
but the highly educated in music.

The general standard of the literary taste that
prevailed among the educated Greeks of the Roman
Empire is shown—for song—by our possession of tho
Anacreontea beside our loss of Anacreon. Some of the
Anacreontea, which date from about B.C. 150 to A.D.
550, show signs of attempts to adapt the old Lyric
metres to the new language-conditions3 Bishop Syne-
sius‚ who lived about 400 A.D., knew the Lyric Poets
and wrote ‘Anacreontic ⁹ Hymns3 in the 7th Century
it was still worth the while of a certain Egyptian
Greek, who was not a good metrician, to copy out the
Fifth Book of Sappho3 recitation-poetry‚ Epic, Ele·
giae, and Iambic, with certain modifications, were still
written in the 6th and 7th Centuries3 the Epigram
indeed lived on till the loth, Iambic to the 12th.
But after that the dark.

‘ I was told when a boy,’ writes Petrus Alcyonius in the
16th Century, ⁶ by Demetrius Chalcondyles, that the
priests of the Greek Church had such influence with the
Byzantina Emperors that they burnt at their request a
large number of the works of the old Greek poets, parti-
cularly those which dealt with the passionS, obscenities,
and follies of lovers, and thus perished the plays of
Menander, Diphilus, Apollodorus, and Alexis, and the
poems of Sappho, Erinna, Anacreon, Mimnermus, Bion,
Alcman, and Alcaeus?
