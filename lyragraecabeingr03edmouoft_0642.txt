ί NEW ⁹-LESBIAN FORMS

‘ Sapphic ’ and ‘Alcaim⁵ to judge by their remaining so
long without imitation, were perhaps peculiarly suited to
the Aeolic accentuati0n3 for the dialect-accent must have
emphasised the particular character of an Aeolian or Dorian
song even more than the ‘ mode ’ in which it was sung.l

Another peculiarity of Aeolic verse is that its arrange-
ment is always strophio, never triadic, even in choral
poetry. Even poems consisting entirely of similar lines,
the prototypes of such odes as Horace's Maecenas atavis
edite reyibus, were considered in Alexandrian times to be
made up of two-line strophes. This would hardly have
been an invention of the Alexandrian editors. The
Triadic arrangement, which, it should be remembered,
involved by custom the construction of a different
metrical system for every poem, is to be recogmsed, as
we have seen, in Alcman’s Partheneion, but in the home
of the Lesbian tradition, as far as our scanty evidence
goes, it never appears. It was probably a Dorian feature.
Compare the Sonq os the Three Aqes. We may remark
here that, although these Lesbian poems were written in
strophes like a modern church-hymn, the music, that is
to say the notes as apart from the rhythm, must have
changed completely from strophe to strophe. The repeti-
tion was metrical not tonal. The same is probably true
of all Greek lyric. If it had been otherwise, the over-
lapping of the sense from strophe to strophe and even—-

1 these modes (ὰρμονίαι, tunings of the lyre) were a series of
limited ‘scales ’ of 7 (or 8) notes differing from one another
mainly, but probably not entirely, in relative pitch ; each of the
series began one note higher than its predecessor; each could
be either in the ‘chromatio ’ or the ‘ diatonic ’ scale, according
to the position of the semitones; they had various emotional
associatione, much as we roughly associate grief with the ‘ minor ’
and joy with the ‘ major ' ; they were named after their origin
(to arrange them from ‘low ’ to ‘high ') Lydian, PhrygiamDorian,
Aeolian‚ Ionian, but this nomenclature eventually underwent
considerable change, ay. the Aeolian became the Hypodorian,
and the Mixolydian (said to have been invented by Sappho) was
added below the Lydian; the Dorian and Aeolian were tradition-
ally proper to Choral and Monodic lyric respectively, the
Phrygian to fiute-music and the Dithyramb‚ the Lydian to
laments, the Ionian to love and pleasure3 anyone who has an
‘ absolute ’ sense of pitch, and has played an elaborate piece of
music he knows well on a piano tuned a tone or a tone-and-a-
half lower than his own, will realise the possibility of this
difference of emotional association
