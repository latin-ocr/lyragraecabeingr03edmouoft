NEW FORMS

It is to be observed in various stages of development in
Homer, Hesiod‚ and the Homeric Hymns. The pro-
cessional song-dance of the Muses to Olympus in l. 68
of the Theoqony (c. 750 B.C.) was clearly conceived by
a man familiar with the Processional Hymn. At l.
515 of the Hymn to the Pythian Apollo (c. 650 B.c.)
the Paean is processionaL led by Apollo φόρμιγγ’ ἐν
χείρεσσιν ἔχων ἐρατὸν κιθαρίζων Ι καλὰ καὶ ὕψι βιβάς, where
the last phrase suggests the song-dance. At 1. 157 of the
much older Hymn to the Delion Apollo (Sth Century)
Delian maidens sing what is apparently the standing
Hymn, like that of Classical times, to Apollo and Artemis;
but we should note that it is there still followed by the
‘ renowns of men.’ Except perhaps for this feature, this
song is essentially a Partheneion. The Wedding Song-
dance and the Linus-Dirge song-dance in Homer have been
mentioned above. In the Shield of Η eracles (7th Century) 1
we have the bridal procession, with a chorus of youths ’
singing 1ο 1116 pipe, and another of maidens dancing to the
lyre3 and the κῶμος 01 revel of young men ‘ some frolick-
ing with danee and song, and others laughing in time with
the fluteplayer as they went along.'

From the earliest form of 1116 Hymn developed in all
probability, as we have seen, the Epic Lay, the Hymn
proper, and, as we shall see later, the N ome. Greek
Choral Melic seems 10 have been derived from a later
‘ return,’ so 10 speak, to 1116 ‘non-art ’ forms, ritual
and once—ritual forms which had long existed side by
side with the art-forms, but which hitherto had not
been drawn upon by professional poet-musicians.
In the 8111 and 7th Centuries these ⁶ non-art ’ forms,
folk-forms, made a number of contributione to the
art-sphere, where the two-time Hexameter had 30
long reigned supreme. ν
Τ11636 were: (l) new 11161163 and rhythms, for instance
the three-time Iambic, Molossus, Ionic, the five-time

Paeon and Cretic‚2 the Elegiae couplet; (2) new subjects
or topics‚ for instance, lamentation, banter and invective,

1 1. 270 2 sometimes, by the lengthening of the first long
syllable, the Cretic was adapted to what we call 6s8 time (or
a double bar of 3); this adaptation is parallel to that of the
ordinarily two-time Dactyl to predominantly Trochaic metron,
which were usually three-time or rather six-time
