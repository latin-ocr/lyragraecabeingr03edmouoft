mingled 3 with saffron, roasi: wheaten-oaten-samphire-
chickpease- thistletop 4 -petticake— sweetmeat-allmix

lentilpod-doughkned oil-boiled—yellow-parched piggi-
cake, sweet round fennel-eakes past number, and
homey-mixed sesame-biscuits ready all in profusion,
with a milk-and-honey-made cheesebread and a fine-
flour platterb1·ead; broadeast also were cheese-and-
sesame—made cakes and oil—boiled sesame-sprinkled
cakes, aye, and saffron-mingled chickpeas luxuriant
