THE DITHYRAMB

seems to have been a comparatively late importation,
yet it in all probability existed, in origin the com-
memorative, once invocatory, rite 01 6 dead hero,
through many generations 01 folk- custom, and with
many local modifications, before it 661116 upon the
stage 01 art.

According to Aristotle its origin lay in Phrygia. The
word Διθύραμβος 13 611 epithet of Dionysus in Pindar and
Euripides. The singer 01 iambi was himself called Ἴαμβος.
We clearly cannot separate in origin διθύραμβος, ἴαμβος,
θρίαμβος, and the Latin triumphus, translated θρίαμβος
by the later Greeks. As with παιάν, 113611 probably non-
Η61161116,1 the ritual epithet used as a refrain came to be
the name 01 1116 song 113611. It may well prove to be
Lvdian.2

“The earliest instance 01 1116 Dithyramb among 1116
Ionians is the fragment 01 Archilochus, ‘ I know how to
lead the dithyramb-song of lord Dionysus with my 3611363
lightning· struck with wine. ’ Among the Dorians we find
the very ancient ³ invocation sung by the Elean women,
where Dionysus' 13 61 01166 6 11610 and a bull but not yet a
God, and where—which marks 611 older stage than 1116
lines 01 Archilochus—there is as yet no mention 01 wine.
As this 13 essentially a Hy1nn, the Dithyramb would seem
to have been an early offshoot 01 1116 ghost-invocation
which in primitive communities would be indistinguish-
able from a rite 01 commemoration. The separation would
only become obvious when the commemorative clement
came to predominate. The word 01 Archilochus, ‘ to
lead,' ἐξάρξαι, 13 used by Homer 01 1116 two tumblers
who lead the dance 01 youths and maidens, in the Shield
os Achilles. We are told by the Scholiast on the Froqs,
where Dionysus in distress says ‘ Call the God,’ that 61 1116
Lenaean festival the torchbearer says ‘ Call ye the God‚’
and those who reply to him cry, ‘ Semelean Iacchus, giver

in Sappho’s Adonis-Songs and Epithalamies‚ was probably
a very ancient feature 01 1116 Dithyramb; but the Elean
Hymn suggests that it was not original. It sui-vives in the
