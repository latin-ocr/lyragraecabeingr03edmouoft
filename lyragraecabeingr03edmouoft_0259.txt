CLEOMENES, LAMYNTHIUS, GNESIPPUS

Scholiast οη the passczye: Hieronymus was a lyric poet and
tragedy-writer whose works were uneven and ill-arranged
because they had too emotional themes and were acted by
characters with too formidable masks, though he seemed to
win applause. He was caricatured for his long hair. That
is why Aristophanes calls him a Death-cap, jesting in the
manner of comedy at his need of the barber.l

The Same Clouds [SOCRATES] : The Clouds can become what-
ever they like; and if they see a fellow with long hair, one
of these wild shaggy men like the son of Xenophantus‚ they
make themselves like Centaurs by way os scoffin g at his idiocy.

Scholiast οη the passage: He means the dithyramb-writer
Hieronymus, who was the son of Xenophantus, and ran too
much after the boys and was always in need of the shears²

on CLEOMENES, LAMYNTHIUS, GNESIPPUS

Athenaeus Doctors at Dimzer: Since you have evaded the
question put to you whether the Calydonian Boar is any-
where stated to have been white, I will tell you where, and
you must investigate the proof. 1 happen to have read not
long ago the Dithyra‘mbs of Cleomenes of Rhegium, in one of
which, entitled Meleaqer, the fact is stated.

The Same [on writers of low songs] : The author of the play
called The Beyqars, attributed to Chionides, speaks of a
certain sportive writer of merry music called Gnesippus in
the following lines ε

Neither Gnesippus nor Cleomenes, I swear, could have
made such a thing palatable on a nine-chord lyre.

The Same: According to Dicaearchus in his book on
Olympia, the Pnrzfications of Empedocles was recited there
by Cleomenes the rhapsode.³

The Same z I too, to quote Epicrates' Anti-Lais:

Am letter-perfect in all the love-songs of Sappho, Meletus‚⁴²
Cleomenes, and Lamynthius.⁵

a writer of tragedy, but his scozia (drinking-songs) are referred
to by Aristophanes Rau. 1302 ⁵ otherwise unknown
