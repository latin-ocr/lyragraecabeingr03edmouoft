AEOLIAN MELIC

as his notion of what is a proper subject for poetry.
In the century, if that be the right estimate, between
Hesiod and these early 7th-Ce11tm‘y poets, the Greeks, .
and particularly the Ionian Greeks in close touch—-
and that connotes sels-contrast—with the civilisations
01 the East, had grown more conscious of themselves,
more introspective, with the result that art-poetry
and art-song———to use ill-sounding but 11301111 terms—
were no longer only the expression of what happened
but also of what was felt. This in a sense was a
reversion3 101 Epic itself, as we have seen reason to
suppose, was ultimately a development 01 1110 primi-
tive incantation, once itself a cry for help, an expres-
sion of feeling. But from the point of view of art
it was an advance. Art lives by periodic reversion
to ⁶ nature.' Moreover the mik-expression, so to
call it, 01 0111011011, tends to be tribal, formal, senten-
tious. An ignorant man speaks in metaphors and
proverbs3 it takes a cultured man to express his own
feelings in his own terms. And so although the lost
forerunners of these poets went back, as it were, to
the people both for the form and the content 01 the
new poetry, it was not from the old popular poetry
that they took the personal outlook. Indeed t-hc
germ 01 this is to be seen in Hesiod himself, but it took
three or four generations to come to 1110.

Athenaeus has preserved a fragment of Archilochus
in which he speaks 01 ‘leading the Lesbian paean
to the flute.' The adjective marks a connexion of
great interest. Contemporary with the 1130 01 the
Ionian Elegiae and Iambic poetry, or perhaps a
little later, comes the 1130 01 1110 AEOLIAN MEL10.1

The instrument of Melic song was originally the lyre.
The word μέλος as applied to this sort of song does not

occur before Herodotus. In Alcman, who flourished in
the latter half of this 7th Century, we find the phrase

ἔπη δέ γα καὶ μέλος, meaning ‘lines and a tiene? So also
Echembrotus speaks of himself early in tho ssth Century

1 writers on Greek literature sometimes use ‘Lyric’ to
include Iambic and Elegiae poetry; in this book it is always
equivalent to ⁴ Melie ’
