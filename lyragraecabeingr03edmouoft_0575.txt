SCOLIA : INTRODUCTION

‘to εἰῖἕ the song of Cleitagora to the tune of the
i metus.'

Another Scholiast: ‘To Cleitagora': Who was a
poetess3 by ‘the song of Cleitagora' is meant the
song to (or on) herself, Cleitagora.

Aristophanes Lysis-trata ε
Nowadays, when we arrive sober at Sparta, we
immediately look to see what mischief we can do,
and therefore what they do say we don’t hear and
what they don't say we suspect, and give them
messages which contradict one another. To—day‘
everything pleased them, so that if anybody were
to have sung the Telamon instead of the Cleitagora,1

we should have thanked him and forsworn our-
selveS.

Scholiast on the passage: The Telamonz—The
beginning of a scolion ‘Son of Telamon, spearman
Aias' . . . The meaning is that we say and do
mutually inconsistent things. For when anybody
sings one of the scolia of Pindar we say that
he ought to sing one of those of the poetess
Cleitagora. Now Cleitagora was a Spartan poetess
mentioned by Aristophanes in the Daughlers of
Danaiis,²

Suidas Leoeicon: Scolionz—(2) Tyrannion wrote a
T reatise on ilze Scolion-M'clre at the instigation of
the Emperor Gaius.
