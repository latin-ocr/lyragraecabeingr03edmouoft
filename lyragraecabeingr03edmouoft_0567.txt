SCOLIA: INTRODUCTION

round one table at weddings, and the guests one
after the other sang proverbs and love-songs of a
serious type, holding twigs of myrtle or laurel. The
course followed among them was skolios or ‘ crooked '
owing to the arrangement of the couches in polygonal
rooms, which made the seating irregular. Thus the
songs, according to these authorities, were not called
crooked because of their metrical structure but
because of the crooked course taken by the myrtle-
twig as it passed from hand to hand.1-(3) In the
Prytaneum or Town-Hall of Athens scolia were sung
over the wine on certain men such as Harmodius,
Admetus, Telamon32 and this type of song was so
called by antiphrasis (or saying the opposite to what
you mean), because they were easy to sing and, like
‘ epigrams’ (or metrical inscriptions), had but few
lines, the guests offering the sprig to each other in
turn, and those who did not sing were thus shown to
be unmusical.3

Scholiast on Aristophanes Clouds [‘ And then I
told him first to take the sprig and recite me some-
thing from Aeschylus] To quote Dicaearchus'
BIusical Competitions, ‘Moreover it appears to be
natural for a man who gives a recitation or a song to
do so with something in his hand. After-dinner
singers by an old-established custom sing holding a
branch of hay or myrtle.’

Plutarch Dinner- Table Problems: We are told that

the Scolia were not a type of obscurely constructed
songs, but were so called because the ancients first
sang to the God a paean in which all the guests

points to these scolia having formed a book; cf. on 14, 15,
21, and Seh. Ar. Ach. 980 (Reitz.) ³ cf. Diogen. 2. 68
