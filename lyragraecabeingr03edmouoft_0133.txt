Fon THE SPARTANS

Once in spacious Lacedaemon the flaxen-haired
daughters of the Spartans danced to such a song
as this, when stout-hear’c Idas1 led home that fair-
eheeked maid 'che violet-tressed Marpessa? when he
had ’scaped the end of death,3 the day sea-lord
Poseidon gave him a chariot and hol-ses like the
wind and sent him to the son of gold-bucklered
Ares 4 at well-built Pleuron .

Scholiasta on Pindar [‘t0 make him eease from roofing
Poseidon’s temple with the skulls of strangers ']: The poet is
peculiar in ascribing the roofing of Poseidon's temple with
the skulls of defeated strangers to Antaeus3 the story is told
of the Thracian Diomede; but Bacchylides relates that

Euenus did this with the suitors of Marpessa, and Sophocles
ascribes the like to Oenomaus.
