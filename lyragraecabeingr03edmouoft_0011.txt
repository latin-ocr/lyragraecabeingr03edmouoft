PREFACE

tributor, and to the staffs of the publisher and printer
for giving satisfactory presentment to many pages
particularly troublesome to set up.

In 3 recent review of a similar collection of frag-
ments, it was objected that the compilers of such
books do not follow some accepted numeration, such
as that of the Teubner series, In this book it was
impossible. New discoveries had made both Bergk
and Hiller-Crusius out of date, and the edition of
Diehl, even if it was to contain all the fragments
and notices gathered in these volumes, had not been
completely published. I hope that the numeration-
tables will do something to ease the difficulty of
tracing old favourites to their new homes.

I take this opportunity of correcting 3 few mis-
takes not yet corrected in Volumes i and ii. On
page 5 of Vol. i. 1. 7, for lyre-sung read flute-sung3
