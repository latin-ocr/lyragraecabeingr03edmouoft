silence. This ear of corn, among the Atvhenians as among

Scholiast on Pindar Pythiam [on the word ὑποκουρίζεσθαι,
of which ‘che usual meaning is ‘ bo address like a child or in
endearing terms']: (l) Here used to mean ‘to sport, and
dance' ; or to sing the praises of t-he κόροι, that is the bride
and bridegroom. (2) He uses this phrase because the singers
sang in their ‘blessing’ ‘With both boys and girls.' And

gracious by the songs of those who have put1 them ‘with
[i.e. made them fathers—to be—of] both boys and girls.’
