Athenaeus Doctors at Dlnncr [on loveJ: According to the
lst Book 01 1116 Erotics 01 Clearchus, Lycophronides truly

says ε

Neither in lad nor golden lass ¹ nor yet in buxom
dame is the face fair which is not modest, for beauty
is engendered of a proper shame.

22

Clearchus in the Same [why‚ when a man’s wreath comes
apart, we say he is in love] : Or is it rather that lovers are
betrayed by their passion into despoiling themselves 01 a
bodily adornment to dedicate it 1ο 0116 who has despoiled
them, as they rightly think, 01 3 spiritual? That is what

every lover does 11 the beloved be there ; and 11 1101, 116 »

dedicates it to whoever is—which is the reason why
Lycophronides makes his lovesick goatherd say ε

Τ1115 rose, with my cap and shoes and game-
slaying javelins, is my fair offering to thee,3 though
my thoughts lie otherwhere, to wit on the lass
Acacallis whom the' Graces love so well.
