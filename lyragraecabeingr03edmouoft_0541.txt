Introduction to Theocritus [the invention of pastoral
poetry]: At Syracuse once, when, after many of the citizens
had perished in civil strife, unity was ree-established, it was
believed that the discord had been the work of Artemis.
The peasants accordingly now brought offerings and joyfully
sang the Goddess' praises, and the people afterwards made
those songs permanent and customary. It seems that they
sang them equipped with a loaf bearing several animal-
shapes, a wallet full of mixed seeds, and some wine in a
goatskin, making libations for anyone they met, with a
garland about them and the antlers of a stag on their heads,
and in their hands a hare-stick or hurlbat. The winner
received the loaf carried by the loser, and remained at
Syracuse while his defeated antagonists went round the
neighbouring villages begging food. The various songs sung

by these peasants were full ot' fun and play and ended with
the following blessin g ε

Receive the good luck, receive the good health,

which we bring from the Goddess for the gifts she
bath had of you.

1 i. e. your son shall marry a wealthy woman who sits on a
chair, not on a stool, in the upper chamber, and will ride in

a mule-car at her wedding ² apparently a floor inlaid
with this metal
