OTHER RITUAL FOLK-SONGS
201

Athenaeus Doctors at Diwzer: According to Hagnocles of
Rhodes in his C'rowmen, the people who went round begging
for the Crow were called Crowmen . . . and their songs
Crow-songs. Another begging song is that of the Swallow‚
which is sung in Rhodes, and of which Theognis writes as
follows in the Qud Book of his lsslzodz'cm Festivals: ‘ There is a
kind of begging-round which the Rhodians call the Swallow-
Round, which takes place in the mouth of Boedromion,² and
receives its name because it is the custom to beg to the

following song :

See ! see! the swallow is here!

She brings a good season, she brings a good year3
White is her breast and black her erest 3

See, the swallow is here.

Ho! roll a fruit· cake from your w ell— filled cot,
Of cheese a fair 1·‚ound of wine a full pot;
&Porridge she’ 11 take, and a bite of haidbake3

She never despisesg oood cheer.

Go we away empty to· day?
An thou wilt give us, we'll up and away ;
But an thou deny us, O here we shall stay.

511311 we take your door and your lintel also,
511311 we take the good wife that is sitting below?

She’s not so tall but we’ll lift her and all-
We can easily bear her away. [Oce]-

Hom. Carm. Asin. 15. 14, Dio Chrys. 53. 5 (⁶ Plato ironically
bids them crown Homer with wool, anoint him with perfume
and send him elsewhere3 which is what the women do with
the swallows ') ² September—October, but it is clearly a
Spring-song, and Theognis prob. mistranslated the Rhodian
inonth into terms of the Attio calendar
