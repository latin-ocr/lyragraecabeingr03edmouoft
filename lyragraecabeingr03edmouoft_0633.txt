ALCMAN

fragment, were seemingly monodic and secular,
following the lead of Polymnastus. Some of these
perhaps were recited rhythmically to a kind of lyre (cf.
Hesych. κλεψίαμβος). Their occasion would be usually
a monodic κῶμος or serenade3 some may have been
sent as letters. Alcman’s F ifth Book was composcd
of Drinking-Songs‚ σκόλια or συμποτικά, probably
developments of the ritual Libation-Songs some of
which seem to have been ascribed to Terpander.

His metres are most commonly Dactylic or Anapaestic,
and Iambic or Trochaic, in both cases with the occasional
use of Spondees, and in the latter with that of resolved
feet. These elements are sometimes combined in the
same line. We also find the Cretic (—v—), said to have
been introduced at Sparta by Thaletas of Crete, and the
Ionic (vv—-), perhaps brought thither by Polymnastus
of Colophon. The occurrence of the Paeon (vvv— or
-ννν) in Alcman is doubtful. Alcman seems to have
had a fondness for the Dactylic Tetrameter, which is
indeed found in Archilochus, but only combined (in the
same line) with other elements3 and if we may trust the
MSS there are seeming traces in his fragments of that
closer combination of Dactyl and Trochee which is some-
times, but incorrectly, called logaoedi0,1 whereas Archilo-
chus keeps these two elements each to its line or part of
the line. These details are given here because they show
the gradual encroachment of the other metres on the
traditional art-form, the Hexameter.

According to Suidas’ authority Alcman was the first
(if this is the right translation) to adopt the practice of
not accompanying the Hexameter with music.² Another
interesting point is the structure of Alcman’s strophas.
The Archilochian stanza never exceeds two lines, of which
the first is divisible by caesura and the second generally
shorter than the first. The stanzas of Alcman, if we may
trust the Alexandrian line-division of the lst Parthcncion,

1 the use of the term for any mixture of Dactyls and Trochees
is amodern and now mostly discredited extension of its use by
Hephaestion for Dactylics with a Trochaie, or for Anapaestics
with an Iambic, close 2 τὸ μὴ ἑξαμέτροις μελωδεῖν; an alter-
native is ‘ singing to lyre or flute songs whose metre was not
Hexameter ’; one is tempted to excise μή, thus making it‘ to
use Hexameters in Melie poetry '
