SEMONIDES: MIMNERMUS

To judge by the two quoted by the Attic orator Lycurgus
—ultimately‚ it is thought, from a military song-book, a
textbook of Spartan education,—his War Elegies or
Exhortations resembled those of Callinus in the naivete'
and vigour of their appeal. Lycurgus gives the occasion
of their use: ⁶ Whenever the Spartans take the field
under arms, every man has by law to be summoned to
the king's tent to hear Tyrtaeus’ songs, this being the
surest way of making him willing to die for his country.’
It was the time of the Second Messenian War. Sent by
the Athenians at a request the Spartans made them, in
obedience to an oracle, that they would send them a
general, Tyrtaeus played the part not only of war—poet
but virtually‚ if not in name, of commander-in-chief.
We also possess some fragments of his Elegy Eunomia,
an exhortation to orderly life. Of his Embateria or Songs
of the Battle-Charge a possible example is printed among
the Folk-Sonqs. It should be noted that these Spartan
Elegies still preserve the Ionic dialect free, or almost
free, of Dorian admixture3 the Embateria on the cher
hand, being anapaestic‚ are entirely in the Doric, having
no foreign tradition to comply with.

The story that Tyrtaeus was a lame schoolmaster
need not be rejected. Music was no doubt a part of
Athenian education from very early times, and an
important part of the musician-poet's profession must
have been to teach his art. Tyrtaeus’ fame was not
confined to Sparta. In Plato's day the young
Athenian learnt his songs by heart.

The Ionian Iambic and Elegiac tradition is con-
tinued in the latter half of the 7th Century by
Semonides of Amorgus, Mimnermus of Colophon,
and Solon the Athenian lawgiver. Of these, SEMO-
NIDES uses the Iambic for satire of a gnomic or moralis-
ing type, and appears to have composed a History
of Samos in Elegiacs. The latter probably at this
time would already be recited rather than sung,
MIMNERMUS‚ who, like his fellow·countryman
Polymnastus‚ wrote F lute-sung Nomes, uses the
Elegy for poems on such themes as love and thc

shortness of life.
One of these, or a Book of them, was addressed to his
