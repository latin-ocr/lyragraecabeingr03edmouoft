ATTIC SCOLIA
22

The man who betrays not his friend hath great
honour methinks both of men and of Gods,

23 ¹ HYBmAs

Some authorities would reckon as 3 scolion the Song of
Hybrias the Cretan‚2 which runs as follows :
My wealth's 3 burly spear and brand
And 3 right good shield of hides untanned
Which on my arm Ι buckle.
With these Ι plough, Ι reap, Ι sow,
With these Ι make the sweet vintage flow
And all around me truckle.

But your wights that take no pride to wield
A massy spear and well-made shield, ’

Nor joy to draw the sword;
Oh, Ι bring those heartless, hapless drones
Down in a trice 011 their marrow-bones

To call me king and lord.3

pared with gold all else is nothing' ; and his actual words

All but gold is nothing after all.
