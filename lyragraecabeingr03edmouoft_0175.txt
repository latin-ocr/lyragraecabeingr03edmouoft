BACCHYLIDES

the good report of men doth follow him also.
Readily am 1 persuadedl to send Hiero a faming
voice without swerving from the path,2 for from such
praise spring good stocks which I pray the Grcat
Gardener may keep undisturbed in peace.3

Fon LAcHoN OF CEos
VlcTOR lN THE [Bors'] FooT-RACE AT Om·.¹‚11³1A4

The feet of Lachon have gotten him of most great
Zeus the best of glories at the outpourings of
Alpheus.⁵ Past number are the deeds for which
young men with wreaths thick upon their locks have
sung erstwhile at Olympia for victories of vine-
rearing Ceos in ring and in race-course. And now
a hymn of Urania queen of song is chanted before
thy house, O wind-footed son of Aristomenes, in
honour of the victory in the foot-race with which
thou hast given Ceos fame.6

1 Hiero had evidently asked for the ode ² zle. ‘my
praise is not- more than the truth' (exaggeration would
invoke Nemesis against the person praised) ³ metaphor

prob. from vine-cuttings or slips, which if they ‘take' well
are left to become trees, cf. Ale. Ox. Pap. 1788. 15. ii. 193
Bacchylides calls his native Ceos ἇμπελοτρόφος and doubtless
knew the process well (34. 5) 4 B.c. 452 ; cf. Oxyrh. Reqz'ster
Ooe. Pap. 222, where the name is given as Λάκων (see on 29
init.); the Cean inscription gives Λαχων Αριστομενεος σταδιον
twice among the Nemean victories ⁵ an untranslatable
play upon the name Laohon suggests a happy omen ⁶ the
ode seems to have been performed as a greeting to the victor
when he returned to Ceos
