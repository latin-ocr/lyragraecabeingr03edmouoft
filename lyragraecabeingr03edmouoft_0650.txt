STESICHORUS

as mere entertainment. The nature of the Nome
will be discussed later. Meanwhile it should be noted
that, apart from his ‘invention ’ of the Triad‚ Stesi-
chorus’ fame seems to have rested on his power as
a narrator. ‘ LonginUS‚’ Quintilian, Antipater of
Sidon, all compare him to Homer. Simonides speaks
of the two in the same breath. The age of the
tyrants was soon to see a repetition of that char-
acteristic of the age of the kings, the court-poet.
The mantle of the singer of the old Epic Lay had
already fallen on the singer of the new Lyric Tale.
But as yet, like the Lesbian Succession at Sparta,
the poe't was patronised by the state. We may
compare Stesichorus’ advice to the Agrigentines to
beware of Phalaris, and his remark to the Locrians
that they must not prove wauton, or the crickets
would chirp from the ground.1 The style here is
reminiscent of the Delphic oracle. Stesichorus is
still the medicine-man, the Hebrew prophet, the
spiritual power rather in the state than of it.

The subjects of his poetry include, besides the
myths of the Epos, certain love-tales—gathered pre-
sumably from the lips of the people—which are of

,ὁ great interest because they furnished models to the

Alexandrian poets. Stesichorus’ Daphnis was the
forerunner of Theocritus’ Sony of Thyrsis, and may
ἣ well be an ancestor, through the Greek NoveL of
modern Romance.

The metres of his few extant fragments show some
combination of Dactylic with Trochaic, especially in the
‘ epitritic ³ close (— ν- - ), but the two-time Dactylic greatly
predominates. Only in the Rhadina, which Strabo
thought to be wrongly ascribed to him, do we find any
possible trace of new-Lesbian influence.

To Stesichorus is perhaps due the beginning of the
structural expansion, both metrical and syntactical,
which we see on comparing an ode of Pindar with an
ode of Alcaeus. VVhether we should accept the ancient
belief that he invented the Triad‚ is doubtful. His name,
