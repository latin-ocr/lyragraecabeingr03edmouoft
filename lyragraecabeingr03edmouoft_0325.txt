TIMOTHEUS

171

Plutarch szfe of Aqesilaz'i-s: A sweet sight it was to the
Greeks of Asia. to see viceroys and generals who had long
been tyrannous and insufferable and consumed with riches
and luxury, now become the craven menials of a man who
went about dressed in a coarse plain cloak, and suiting their
actions to the short and sharp words of command affected
by the Spartans. Well might many of them repeat Timo-
theus' line ι

Ares is king3 Greece fears no gold.2

Zenobius Proverbs: Ares is king :*a phrase from the
Persians of Timotheus, which owing to the success the poem
met with at Athens spread and survived as a proverb.3 It
is mentioned in the Thais of Menander.

Dionysius of Halicarnassus Literary Composition [the
Cretic]: There remains one type of three-syllable rhythm
which consists of two longs and a short, and makes three
kinds of metre. lf it has the short in the middle and the
longs at either end it is called a cretio, and it is not an
ignoble metre. This is an example of it:

And they hastened forward with their floating
chariots bronze-enipointed.5
