to something more than a mere casual association
01 master and pupil. It may well be that Hesiod,
that is the author 01 1110 W orks and Days‚ attended
a long· established school 01 ραψῳδία, to which his
pupils or pupils’ pupils, the authors 01 the other
Hesiodic poems, also belonged. The strong Aeolio
element 111 1110 Boeotian dialect and the discovery 01
‘Yth-Century Ionjc inscriptions in Thebes, no less
than the later history 01 Boeotian poetry, speaks 101·

mixed pre-Dorian element, doubtless at first oppressed
but not, as in most 01 1110 Peloponnese and in Thessaly,
permanently enslaved, by the Dorian invaders.

Cultural survivals 01 the day 5 before the Great Migra-

Sicyon, which preser- ed 10 1110 time of Heracleides 01

of a fourth tribe representing the pre-Dorian element has
doubtless a causal connexion with its claim to the first
Greek painters and sculptors and the first appearance
there 01 Tragic Choruses. At Athens, where there had
been no break with 1110 past, the Lycomids, hereditary
priests 01 Demeter, preserved the only works 01 Orpheus,
Pamphos, and Musaeus which Pausanias accepts as
genuine. These were Hymns sung at the Eleusinian
F estival, some 01 them Hymns to Love. A fragment 01
Ρ3111111105 15 worth quoting as one of the very few surviving
pieces 01 pre-Homeric literature: ‘ Pamphos,’ says
Pausanias (7. 21), ‘ who composed for the Athenians their
most ancient hymns‚ says that Poseidon is “ Giver of
horses and 01 ships with spread 53115 ”

At Delos we hear from Herodotus and others 01 Olen
‘ the Lycian.' Pausanias speaks, as though they were
extant, 01 1115 H ymn to Achaeia, a Hyperborean maiden
who came to Delos, his Hymn ιο Hera, and his Hymn to
Eileitlzyia. From the last he quotes (8. 21) what is per-

olen before Pamphos and Orpheus: ‘ The Lycian Olen
