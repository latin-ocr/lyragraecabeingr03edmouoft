103 SONG or HARMomcs

No man was ever born at Athens [who . . .] 4

I’ll carry my sword in a myrtle-branch, like Har-
modius and Aristogeiton when they slew the despot
and made Athens free.-Dearest Harmodius, I know
thou art not dead, because they tell me thou art in
the Islands of the Blest, where Achilles lives still,
and brave Diomed.5—-I’ll carry my sword in a myrtle-
branch, like Harmodius and Aristogeiton when at the
F east of Athena they killed the despot Hipparchus.
—Your fame shall live in the earth for ever, dearest
Harmodius and Aristogeiton‚ how you slew the
despot and made Athens free.

⁴ (not in Ath.) this seems to have been the first line of the
Harmodius-song in the collection known to Aristophanes,
cf. Vaep. 1224 (above, p. 554) ⁵ Sch. Ar. Ach. 980 makes
this the first stanza, adding ‘ they sang it to Harmodius and
Aristogeiton as destroyers of the despotism of the sons of
Peisistratus3 there were other songs too, one called that of
Admetus, the'other Telamon’s '
