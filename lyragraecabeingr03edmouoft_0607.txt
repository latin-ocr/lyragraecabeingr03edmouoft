THE HOMERIC HYMNS

of the people. Homer glorifies war and kingship
like the court-poets before him. By Hesiod's time
the force of the royal tradition has weakened. The
poet now detests war, and his audience—and with it
his subject-matter—has widened. Hesiod is a popular
poet who uses the old metre for new subjects. He
writes more for the gatherings at the forge and less
for the feasts in the baronial hall. Epic poetry,
long become a mere entertainment, takes new life
as a means of instruction. The poet resumes his
ancient rffle of prophet. For our present purpose
the greatest thing about Hesiod is that he speaks
not only of the real present instead of an ideal past,
but of himself. This, as far as we can tell, was neW.
But we must remember his Aeolio ancestry. The
personal note which rings so clear in the poems of
Sappho and Alcaeus may well have been struck in
Aeolis, as we shall see, before their day.

The same period produced the earliest of the
Hom-Eme HYMNs. The Heroic Lay which was the
material of Homer’s Epics seems once to have been
the secular, the purely narrative, portion of a sacri-
ficial song of which the Hymn, part invocation,

parttheogony, part prayer, was the sacred or ritual
portion.

The extant Hymns have a way of referring to a ‘ praise
of men ’ to follow, and Thucydides calls the Hymn to
Apollo a proem or prelude.l Now early ritual song, for
instance Olen’s Delian Hymn and the hymn performed
by the Gods at the beginning of the H ιψηη to the Pythian
Apollo, was danced, as primitive poetry generally if not
always is; yet the Hymn proper of the Greek classical
times was not.² It is possible that it was the use of the
narrative part as a mere story-telling which reacted at
an early period on the ritual part, and caused it ultimately
to drop the dance. The process of division was doubt-
less slow, occasional long before it was usual3 and even
after it had come about, the dance seems sometimes to
have been thought proper for the Hymn. Of the three
