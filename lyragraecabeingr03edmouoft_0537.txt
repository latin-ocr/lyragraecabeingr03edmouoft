OTH ER RITUAL FOLK-SONGS

17

Plutarch sze of Theseus: After he had buried his father,
Theseus paid his vows to Apollo on the seventh day of
Pyanopsion, which was the day on which they went up to
Athens after their safe return.1 Now the custom of boiling
pulse (on that day) is said to have come from the rescued
youths² hav mg mixed together their remaining provisions in
a common boiling- -pot and made merry 03 er it at ἰ common
board. The Είνεείοηὲ which is carried at the same festival
is an olive· branch wreathed with 33 001, such as Theseus used
for his supplication,³ and laden with all sorts of fruit-offerings
in token that the dearth was over, and those who carry it
sing: ‘Eiresiona etc.' But according to some authorities
the rite commemorates the children of Heracles who were
thus brought up by the Athenians. The former explanation,
however, is more generally given.

Aristophanes Kniyhts: What's all this shouting? go away
from the door. You've torn my Eiresz'one‘ all to shreds.

Scholiast on the passage: (α) The Eiresiom} was an olive-
branch bound round with fillets of wool, with all kinds of
fruits in season fastened to it. They set it up before their
doors to this day. This is done in accordance with an
ancient oracle, which 33 hen the Pythian Apollo uas consultcd
about a world· wide famine—01, as some authorities declat-‚e
a plague—‚ directed the Athenians to ce emate a fore- tillage
sacrifice on behalf of the world in general. This they did
and the visitation ceased. And so it was that firstlings of
all fruits were sent to the Atheniens from all parts as a
thank·offering. . . . And this is why, to the present day,
when they set up the branch they say:

Eiresione brings figs and fat loaves and honey in
the pot, oil to wipe from the body, and a cup of
neat liquor to send her to bed drunk.

(b) The Athenians hold to the Sun and the Seasons festivals
called Pyanepsia and Thargelia.4 At these the children
carry the boughs wreathed with the wool which gives them
their name cireszssonae,⁵ and hang them before the house-doors.
The ‘ seasons ’ ⁶ are fastened to the boughs.

festivals were held m Oct. -Nox. and May-June respectively
⁵ derivation obscure, but popularly connected with ἔρια( wool'
⁶ apparently the technical name of the various fruits (W il.)
