LIFE OF TIMOTHEUS

the competition has been of that type ever
since. Terpander appears to have been the first to
perfect the Nome by the employment of the heroic
metre, but no small contribution was made after him
by Arion of Methymna, who like him was both poet
and singer to the lyre. Innovations were also made
in it by Phrynis of Mytilene, who both combined the
hexameter with the ‘free ' type of metre, and first
employed more strings than the traditional seven.
Timotheus afterwards brought it to its present con-
dition.1 The Dithyramb is full of movement and,
expressing a high degree of ‘ possession ’ by means
of the dance, is directed to evoking the emotions
most characteristic of the God3 wild, too, in its
rhythms, it nevertheless employs a simple phrase-
ology. The Nome, on the other hand, is sustained
in an orderly and dignified style by the characters it
describes 3 while its rhythms are easy and tranquil,
it employs compound expressions.2 Each type, of
course, uses its peculiar ‘ modes,’ the Dithyramb the
Phrygian and Hypophrygian, the Nome the Lydian
system of the singers to the lyre. The Dithyramb
seems to have developed out of the country festivities
and the merrymaking at drinking-bouts, while the
Nome is probably derived from the Paean, the former
being of general application, a supplication composed
to avert evil, the latter a private and personal appeal
to Apollo. Hence the Nome is without the element
of ‘possession’ which is found in the Dithyramb.
For while in that we find drinking and sport, in the
Nome we find supplications and great orderliness,
since the actual deity concerned pervades the music,
which is orderly and systematically constructed.
