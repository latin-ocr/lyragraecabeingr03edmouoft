THE IAMBIC

the flutc himself. The coincidence of dates indicates
that in the first quarter of the Gth Century the fiute-
players were working up their case on the mytho·
logical side. It is to be noted that we are told that

the fluteplayers mentioned by Alcman had Phrygian
names.

All the same, it must not be supposed that the fiute
had nothing to do with Apollo till 586. We are told
that the first fluteplayer to use the Lydian mode was
Olympus in his lament for the serpent Python3 and as
such a lament can only be conceived as part of the Delphian
ritual, this would take the use of the flute at Delphi back
to the early 7th Century at least. The truth would seem
to be that the fiute had long taken part in the ritual of
Apollo, but for some reason, probably the great vogue
of the lyrist-minstrels as we see it in Homer, it was not
given the same prominence as the lyre.

The attempt of the fluteplayers to win recognition
in the Pythian contests was, as we have seen, only
partly successful. The contest in the Flute·sung
Nome—which seems to have been in the Elegiac
metre and at first choral-—was not repeated. Else-
where, however, we hear of F lute-song, notably in
the ‘ solos ’ of Attio Drama, down to the last century
B.C. Meanwhile flute-playinq continued to flourish
all over Greece. At Sparta it was the custom to
march into battle to the sound of.flutes; flutes
accompanied not only wrestling and other exercise
of the palaestra at AthenS, but many occupations
such as building, reaping, baking‚ everywhere: and
in the Dorio Choral Melie, as we shall see, the fiute
came to play a great part.

Another seemingly new type of poetry to appear
in the 7th Century was the IAMBIC. VVhatever the
derivation of the word ἴαμβος, it cannot be dis-
sociated from that of διθύραμβος, which will be
discussed later. It occurs first in Archilochus: ‘ I
care neither for iambi nor for delightS‚’ where the
context shows that the citation was believed to be a
reply to those who were trying to force him to pore
over his bookS. The exact meaning he attached to
