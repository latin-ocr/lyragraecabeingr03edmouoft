TE LESTES

41 H vnn-:NA Eos

Athenaeus Doclors αἰ Βίηηεί· [on the stringed instrument
called 9ηας](ιᾱι’3]; Telestes in his Dithyramb Hfflnenaeus tells
us in the following lines than it had five strings ε

Then uttering various din they roused ’che horn-
voiced2 magadis, with five-lined jointure of strings
plying the to-and-fro footrace of swift hands.³

Athenaeus Doctors αι Diuum: The Phrygias] and Lydian
‘ modes‚’ which were of foreign origin, were made known to
the Greeks through the Phrygians and Lydians who emi-
grated to the Peloponnese with Pelops . . . Hence the
passage of Telestes of Selinus ε

The first to sing the Phrygian tune of the Moun-
tain Mother amid flutes over the wine-bowls of
Greece were they that attended upon Pelops; and
the Greeks forthwith began to thrum the Lydian

hymn with shrill-voiced twanging of the lute.

The Same [on the cup called plzz'alaeH: And Theopompus
in his play Althaea says: ‘ She took the brimming cup of
gold mid-bossed, but Telestes called it, “boat''’, Telestes
evidently having used the word

boat
for the phiale. 7
