BACCHYLIDES

Give thy unerring brain a gentle respite from its
cares, and turn thy mind's eye this way, to look if it
was with aid of the buxom Graces that a guest-friend
of thine renowned as a servitor of golden-coifed
Urania wove the song of praise he sent to a
renowned city from a sacred isle.1 Fain would he
pour the voice from his breast in praise of Hiero.
Cleaving the deep sky alost with his swift brown
pinions the eagle—messenger of the wide—dominioned
Thunderer putteth sure trust in his mighty strength,
and the shrill-voiced birds, they cower in fear. No
stay to him are the summits of the great earth nor yet
the steepy billows of the unwearied brine, but in a
void unabating sped by a breeze from the west, plies
he his glossy plumage conspicuous to the eye. Even
so for me now are there paths ten thousand every
way to praise your prowess,2 O ye lordly children
of Deinomenes,3 by grace both of dark-haired
V ictory and of brazen-breasted ΠΜ· ; 4 may Heaven
never weary of blessing you! Gold-armed Morn
saw that storm-swift courser the tawny Pherenicus
