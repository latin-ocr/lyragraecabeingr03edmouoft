THE DITHYRAMBS OF PHILOXENUS
5

Aristophanes Plutus (continual) : CHORUs: But bleating
the Cyclops' ting-a-ling, we will find you, my friend, keeping
your sheep all dirty and drunken

with a scrip full of dewy wild potherbs,

and when you've just dropped off to sleep we'll take a great
burning skewer and try to put your eyes out.

Scholiast on the passczye ε ‘ With a scrip ' 2—(1) This phrase
also comes from Philoxenus: (2) here the poet playfully
attacks Philoxenus’ poem where he makes the Cyclops carry
a scrip or wallet and eat potherbs. For that is how he
dresses the man who act-s the Cyclops. And Aristophanes
mentions the blinding, because it is found in the work of
Philoxenus . .

Scholiast on Theocritus : And Philoxenus makes the
Cyclops console himself for his love of Galatea and order the
dolphins to take word to her that he is assuaging the pain of
love with the Muses.

Plutarch Dinner-table Problems: Sossius was asked in what
passage Philoxenus says that the Cyclops

tries to heal with the tuneful Muses

the pains of love.¹

Diogenian Proverbs :
the wood took fire ;

a saying used of things that take place rapid1y3 the
metaphor comes from the Cyclops.
