LIFE OF CINESIAS

Aristophanes Frogs: HERACLES (describing [ladas->2
Then miles of mire and niue-k everlasting, and lying
in it everyone who has wronged a stmuger, bilked
a harlot, beaten his mother, boxed his father, per-
jured himself, or made himself a copy of a speech
from a play of Morsi1nus.-—D1oxx·s=0s: By the Gods‚
that’s the place too for anyone who's learnt
Cinesias’ sword-dance.1

Scholiast on llze passage (161); Cinesias was a
dithyramb-writer, who composed a ⁶ pyrrhich ’ dance
. . . Cinesias attacked the comedy-writers on the
ground that they had nothing to say. He was a
nervous, timid man, and wasted to a skeleton . . ‚²

Aristophanes Frogs: Dmxvsus, Aescmmus, Euni-
PinEs: D. But once again, let each declare his
plan for saving the State—E. ‘I know and I will
tell you what I know.'—D. Tell away. E. Suppose
Cinesias were to be made into wings for Cleoeritus,
so that he could ‘soar high aloft over the ocean
wave’-D. It would make a funny sight3 but what’s
the sense of it ?-E. Suppose the fleets fought, and
they took cruets up and sent a shower of vinegar
into the eyes of the enemy.

Scholiast on the passage ε Cinesias was a thin man,
and Cleocritus a profligate. He means, if you were
to fasten Cinesias instead of wings to Cleocritus so
that they rose in the air, the result would be that
they would be carried away for good by the wind.—
He is caricatured as being excessively thin and as
a foreigner and a toady. Cleocritus is mentioned
because he was hand and glove with Cinesias.

Theban‚’ which is thought to be a mistake
