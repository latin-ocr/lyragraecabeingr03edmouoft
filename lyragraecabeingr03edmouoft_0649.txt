XANTHUS: STESICHORUS

have mention of a Takiny of Troy, and of the latter
we hear of the Pythian N ome, a musical representa-
tion, in five ‘ movementS,’ of the fight between
Apollo and the Serpent. Sacadas is mentioned with
Thaletas as an innovator in rhythm. Another
recorded name of this period, XANTHUS, is famous as
that of the earliest known composer of an Orestem,
probably a Lyre-Sung N ome.

The life of STESICHORUS of Locri, called vof Himera
(if that be the solution of the puzzle of his identity)‚
who was reckoned of the Nine Great Lyric Poets,
would seem to lie between 630 and 550. ῌθ drew
for themes upon his predecessor Xanthus, and his
Lyre-‘Sung Nomes, if these they were, owed some-
thing to (the younger ⁴2) Olympus.

He is connected in various passages of ancient authors
not only with Himera and Locri (or Mataurus) but with
Acragas and with the Arcadian town of Pallantium,
whence he is said to have been banished to Catana in
Sicily, the place of his burial. He seemingly did not
belong to the half-Lesbian school of Sparta, and though
he was contemporary with Sappho and Alcaeus, shows
no trace of what we may call the new-Lesbian tradition.

His poems‚ arranged at Alexandria in twenty-six
Books, ran some of them to more tha-n one, though
we hear of no generic titles but H ymns, Paeane and
Love-Sonqs. He calls his Helen a Proem or Prelude,
and his Calyce, which became a folk-song among the “
women of Greece, can hardly perhaps have been
choral. The longer poems‚ as we shall see, were
probably Lyre-Sung Nomes, divided perhaps into long
episodeS.l Such Monodies, as they seem to have
been, would have the advantage over Choral poetry,
as Timotheus saw many years after, in being more
easily heard as words, and therefore more suitable

1 the omission of his name by Proclus on the Nome is not
conclusive against this view; he also omits Corinna; moreover
the Nome and the Prelude were often confused (see below,
p. 674); that they were Dithyrambs is hardly possible at this
early stage of the Dithyramb's development; but some of

them may have been Hymns, since Clement calls Stesichorus
the inventor of the Hymn 6 3
