THE DITHYRAMBS OF PHILOXENUS

praises as follows : ‘ The poet Philoxenus stands in a
class by himself. In the first place he uses new
words of his own everywhere. Secondly‚ how well
he mingles his music with changes of time and key!
He was a God among men ; sor he knew what true
music is. As for the poets of to-day, setting other
men’s tunes to their miserable words they write
ivy-wreathed, fountain-clear, {lower-liovering, but
miserable‚ stuffi'

THE DITHYRAMBS OF PHILOXENUS OF
CYTHERA

1-11 (ἔγειοΡε oa GALATEA

Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner: According to Phaenias, the
poet Philoxenus of Cythera, who loved a good (linner, supping
one day with Dionysius and observing that the prinee was
served with a large mullet and himself with a small one,
took his mullet up and put it to his ear. then Dionysius
asked why he did so, he replied that being engaged on his
Galatea lie wanted his fish to give him news of Nereus'
country, and that she had answered ‘ I have been caught too
young to understand it; Dionysius’ mullet is older aud cau
give you all inforination.' &Vliereupon the prinee burst out
laughing and sent him his own fish. It seems that Philoxenus
was one of Dionysius' favourite botae-companium, and when
he was caught one day in the arms of his patron’s mistress
Galatea, he was committed to the stone-quarry. And it was
there that he composed the Cyclops story to fit to his own
history, modelling his Cyclops on Dionysius, his nymph
Galatea on Galatea the flute-player, and Odysseus on himself.
