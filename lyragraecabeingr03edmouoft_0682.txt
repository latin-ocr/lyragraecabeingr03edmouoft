THE PARTHENEION

The poem is really a special kind of PARTHENEION’
showing a family resemblance to the partly extant
Maiden-Song of Alcman.

lVe are told that Pindar's Partheneia were almost
exceptional among his works as displaying less of the
‘ archaic and austere style ⁹ otherwise characteristic of
him.1 It may be, if we may judge by the remains of
Alcman’s, that the difference lay in a lighter tone, though
this is hardly borne out by the fragments. The Par-
theneion was a sort of Processional song-dance allied to
the Hymn, but still containing the secular elements of
which the Hymn seems, as we have seen, to have divested
itself by a process of budding-off, and always, as the name
implies, sung by maidens. Of Alcman’s work in this kind
we have already spoken on p. 615. Here it is enough to
add that in the hands of its ‘ inventor ' it is clearly charac-
terised in its personal part by a merry badinage between
teacher and taught,2 sometimes delivered in the poet's
own person, sometimes in his choir's, which speaks for the
happy relations between them, and throws a pleasing
light on the position of women in Dorian communities.
We hear of Maiden-Songs by Simonides and Bacchylides ;
we have a few fragments of Pindar’s three Books and. a
few lines which may come from Partheneia by Telesilla
and Corinna 3 and in a recently restored papyrus, a passage
from the hitherto unknown Book of these songs by
Anacreon. This new fragment is important because it
shows that of the Choral songs sung by women the Maiden-
Song, at any rate, was not confined to the Dorians and
Aeolians.

It is now time to resume our story, which broke off
at the end of the ‘ Canon ³ of the Lyric Poets. Though
local competitions both in song and in the games still
went on all over Greece,³ sometimes, as at Syracuse,
attaining more than local importance, most of the
greater poetical and musical talent of the 5th and. 4th
Centuries appears to have been absorbed by the
Dionysiae contests at Athens. The Dithyramb
