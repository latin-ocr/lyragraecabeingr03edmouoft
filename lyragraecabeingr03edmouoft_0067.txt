Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner [on flutes]: According to
Pratinas 1 of Phlius, at a time when hired flute-players and
chorus-dancers occupied the ογσῖιεείναε, some anger was
arousedl because the fiute—playing was not, an acconipani-
ment to the singing of the choruses as of old, but the singing
of the ehoruses an accompaniment to the flute-playing.
Pratinas’ feeling iu the matter is shown by the following

Hyporeheme or Dance-Song ε

What clamour is this, what measures are here?
What outrage is befallen on the patter-cstcled altar
Dionysiae? Το me belongs Bromius, to me. Itis
I that should sing, it is I that should ring, as Ι speed
me o'er the hills with the Naiads like a swan ’chat
makes his motley-feathered tune. Song's the queen
Muse hath made3 the flute, he must dance second
as become'ch a servant3 let him captain the revels if
he will, the fist-to-fist door-battery of the tipsy and
the young. Beat O beat him that breathes the
breath of a speckled toad !2 To the flames with this
reedy spender of spittle, bawler of bibble-babble,
counter—runner unto time and unto tune, this hire-

¹ reading uncertain ; perh. ‘the anger of P. was aroused '
(ἠγανάκτησεν or, with Wil.‚ ἀγανακτήσας ἐπὶ κτλ. With
asyndeton) ² probably a punning reference to the tragic

poet Phrynichus (= little toad)
