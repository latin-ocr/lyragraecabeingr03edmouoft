FLUTE-SONG

Epic Hexameter, which at the most was equivalent to
only a short syllable. .

Just as the lyre—metre, the Hexameter‚ once the
metre of the Hymn, probably came, as we have
seen, to be used for the Epic Lay, and the Epic Lay
developed into Hexameter poems of various sorts,
so the flute·metre, the Elegiae, came to be used by
the Sth-Century Ionians for Eleqiac poems of various
sorts. While Clonas, the so-called inventor of the
F lute-sung Nome, probably used it at Sparta in the
Nome called Eleyos when the Nome was still hieratio,
his later contemporary Callinus of Ephesus uses it
for the purely secular piupose of a WVar-Song, and
Archilochus of Paros not much, if any, later employs
it for consolation, lament, account-s of war and
travel, and what not. This change of purpose,
which of course came gradually—for Callinus also
wrote an Elegy to Zeus—was, as we shall see, of
the utmost importance.

Continuing his account of the early Pythian con-
tests (7. 2), Pausanias tells us that the first competitions
at Delphi were musico-poetica13 not till the First
Pythiad (586 Ro.) was the athlet-ic clement brought
in, and at the same date the musico-poetical ‘ events ’
were extended to include, besides the immemorial
Singing to the Lyre, Flute-song and Flute·playing;
at the Second Pythiad (582 B.o.) ‘ the Amphictyons
discontinued the Flute-song because they decided
that it was not an auspicious form of music ’—that
is, unsuitable for a ritual which was intended to
invoke the favour of the Gods —3 ‘for it con-
sisted of very doleful fiute-music with Elegies ’—
ἐλεγεῖα glossed θρῆι-οι-“ sung to its accompaniment.’
This left the Lyre-song for the poet-musician and
the F lute-playing for t-he musician. At the Eighth
Pythiad (558 Ro.) the Lyre-playing interest, as we
should call it, succeeded in inducing the Amphictyons
to include a contest in Lyre-playing. Now in Alcaeus’
H ymn to Apollo the Delphjans were represented as
singing and dancing a Paean to flutes; moreover
Alcman said in a lost passage that Apollo played
