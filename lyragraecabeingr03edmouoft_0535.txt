OTHER RITUAL FOLK-SONGS

And not only in literature but in life, some people when
exhorting the newly-ularried pair, instead of ἀκορεΐ κόρας
κορωνᾶς (which contains the word ‘ girls ’) say ἐκκόρει κόρους
κορώνας (which contains the word ‘boys ').¹

Horapollo Hie7·oylyplzics [on crows]: Even to this day,
because of this mutual affection between {nat-ed crows, the

Greeks say to the bride at a wedding el· kori Icorz' Ιεοτὸηέ
[Come here pretty crow ?] without knowing what it means.

Hesychius Glossary κουριζόμενοςε This means ‘having the
wedding song sung to oue‚’ because they said to girls being
married ‘ with both boys and girls’ ; which now is corrupted
to ἐκκορεΐν ‘ sweep out ' [or ‘ supply well' ?]²

Aelian Natural History: I understand that at a wedding
too the ancients, after singing the wedding-song‚ invoked the
Cr0w‚ thus presenting the newly-married pair with a token
of mutual affection, for the begett-ing of children.

Ho, pretty crow, pretty crow ἵ
And bring both boys and girls !3

Athenaeus Doctors at Dimwr: The loaf named ἀχαΐνας is
mentioned by Senius in the Sth Book of his Dchad, where he
says that such loaves were made by the Thesmophori. They
are large loaves, and the feast is called Megalartia or Great-
Loafings, the people who carry them crying—

Bite a great-loaf full of fat.

² the point seems to be that the masc. κόροι ean be used
as well as the fem. κόραι, and here is collective of the married
pair; the first half of the original incantation was prob. in
the form preserved by Horap.; the Scholiast records two
popular corruptions, one of which was perh. thought to mean
‘ Deflower the daughters of the crow . . (or the crow-girls . .)‚’
the other ‘ Supply well (κορέω == κορέννυμι) the son and
daughter of the crow . . (or the crow-children . .)‚' both
sentences being eompleted in the next line ² some words
seem to have fallen out ³ crows seem to have been eon·
