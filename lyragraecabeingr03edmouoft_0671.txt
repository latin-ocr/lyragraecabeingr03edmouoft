THE EPINICION

yet hope drives us to embark on high designs; we should
therefore pursue advantage moderately‚ ‘for fiercest is
the madness that comes of desires unattainable.' Tho
word ἐγκώμιον came to be used of any song of praise
addressed to an individual, for instance Simonides' Dirge
On those who fell ab Thermopylae ,· and the type eventually
evolved both ‘ Epic ’ Eulogies‚ which presumably were
recited, and prose panegyrics. The extension of the term
to other forms of Melie was really a reversion; for it was
the songs of the κῶμος that were in all probability the
forbears of the Victory-Song‚ the Drinking-Song‚ and the
Serenade and other Love-Songs.

Indeed the distinction between a Eulogy and an

⁹ Epinicion or VIoTole-SONG was probably first

drawn at Alexandria.. In any case, what difference
there was came of the accident that the 5th-Century
Greek honoured commons as well as kfflgs, and
the victor in the Games, whatever his rank, became
a man of the highest distinction.

A prototype of the Victory-Song is Archilochus' so-
called ‘ Hymn ’ of Victory to Heracles‚ celebrating his own
success in the competitive hymn to Demeter (see p. 606).
In those days a poet could sing of his own prowess—if he
remembered to ‘ ascribe all to God '-—for instance in the
‘ seal ’ of a Nome or Partheneion3 but it was probably
some generations yet before the true Encomium became
an art-form, and perhaps another generation before it
evolved the Epinicion proper. We ¹have fragments of
Victory-songs by Simonides dating from the last decade of
the 6th Century3 the earliest of Pindar’s forty-three was
written in 498. Thanks to the preservation of Pindar's
Epinicia and some of those of Bacchylides, discussions of
the form, contents, and occasions of this type of choral
song-dance are easily available elsewhere.l Here it is
enough to remind the reader that after the year 573, of
every four years the first saw an Olympic F estival in
July or August, the third a Pythian in August, the second
and fourth an Isthmian in the Spring and a Nemean in
July; and there were a very great number of lesser
festivals of a. similar kind. At all these the athletic
‘ events ’ aroused the widest interest, but we should
remember that Pindar celebrates a Pythian victory in the
