ORIGINS OF CHORAL MELIC

It is now time to step back to the early history of
Greek CHORAL MELIC. Among the various forms
of this kind of poetry are some to which belong certain
refrainS, ἰήιε παιάν to the Paean, ὦ δὶθύραμβε to the
Dithyramb‚ ὑμὴν ὑμέναιε to the xveddhlg-Sollg, αἴλινον
to the Lament. ²

These refrains, called by the later Greeks ἐφύμνια and
in origin probably identical with the ἐπῳδός, whose name
indeed 1s sometimes given them, are doubtless the oldest,
and probably also the most truly ritual, parts of the
song-element in the song-dances in which we find them.
The lengthened vowel in two of them, like such forms as
μαχεούμενος in Homer, betokens metrical adjustment,
perhaps of stress-elements to the conditions of a pitch-
language. Without pressing the parallelism unduly, we
may note here that some of the old N orse ballads of the
Shetlands have come down to us with the body of the
stanza in an English translation, but with the refrain—
which is comparatively unimportant as mere entertain-
ment—still untranslated. Some of the traditional
English carolscsimilarly have the refrain in Latin. It
would seem then that the refrain resists change more
obstinately than the rest of the song, and the apparently
non-Hellenic character of the Greek refrains points to a
language shift. It should be noted here that ἰήιε παιάν
recalls the Hexameter, and the Hexameter was closely
connected with Apollo; while ὦ διθύραμβε is Iambic, and
the Iambic was associated with Dionysus as well as
Demeter.2 The song itself was doubtless called after tho
restam-wath, διθύραμβος, eta—and not vice versa.

The Refrain in its earliest stage probably arose out
of one or both of these elements: (l) the cult cry·
and-movemen‘te—to use a term more applica-blo here
than song-dance—of the crowd during the performance
of a cult-act by one or a few of their number, an act
in which most of them could share only vicariously,
such as the slaying of an ox3 (2) the ‘ occupational ’
cry-and-movement of a number of people doing the

l the war-ories ἐλελεῦ (01- ἐλελελεῦ) and ἁλαλά are formal eries
which might have but apparently did not become refrains3
ἐλελεῦ was also used in lamentation 2 it should be added that

ἐλελεῦ and ἀλαλά, like the Embateriffi are Anapaestic, and that
Euripides uses Anapaests in a lament, Hcc. 155 ff.
