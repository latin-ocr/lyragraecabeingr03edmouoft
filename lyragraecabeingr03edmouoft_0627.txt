TERPANDER

mented from Plutarch Mus. 8 (vol. i, p. 7). Some
of those mentioned were Dorians, one at least an
Ionian, but in the full list there was doubtless a
predominance of Aeolians.l According to Plutarch,
the last Lesbian citharode to win the prize at the
Spartan Carneia was Pericleitus, who seems to have
flourished about 550. The great days, then, of
Spartan patronage of poetry lasted for rat-her over a
century, though it must not be supposed that it now
ceased. The Arqument to Theocritus (p. 616 n. 3)
implies that Maiden-Songs were sung at Sparta as
late as the time of the Persian XVars, and the Birds
of Aristophanes (ll Schol.) mentions a contemporary
victor at the Carneia.

The above passages, even if they stood alone,
would prove the early existence of poetico-musical
contests (ἀγῶνες) elsewhere than at great religious
centres like Delphi. It is doubtless true that there
had long been competitions in ‘ music ’ and athletics
(which it should be remembered were the two great
branches of Greek education) in connexion with many
local cults all over Greece, and at these hundreds of
poet—musician-schoolmasters competed of whom we
shall never know the names. All these took part in
the development of Greek poetry‚ and it is a serious
error to imagine that the great personages whom we
know of are the only factors in the problem of its
history.

Some of the most famous poems‚ which no doubt won
prizes at the Carneia during this period, survivcd not
only in books but as folk-songs. ‘ During the Theban
invasion of Laconia (370 B.o.) the Helot prisoners ’ says
Plutarch 2 ‘ refused to sing at the bidding of their captors

the songs of Terpander or Alcman or Spendon the Laconian‚
on the plea that their masters never allowed it.’

Among the fragments of the poetry ascribed to
Terpander we find a H ymn to Zeus and an Hexameter
Lyre-sunq N ome to Apollo called the Orthian or

² see vol. i, p. 29: in Sa. 148 the phrase ‘Lesbian poet‚‘
usually taken to refer to Terpander, may be general 2 Lyc. 28
