TIMOTHEUS
20 1

Plutarch: Whether S‘els-Praz‘se is Permissible: But a man
who wins the wreath in a competition is proclaimed hy
another person, and obviates the unpleasantness of the
blowing of one's own trumpet‚ which we rightly dislike in
Timotheus where he writes of his victory over Phrynis:

A happy man were you, Timotheus, when the
herald cried that the winner was Timotheus of
Miletus over the Ionian triller the son of Camon.2

For we feel that with entire disregard of taste and custom
he is advertising his own victory.

me, ete.⁴¹

then striking the earth with his hand he quoted from the

Ambe I’m coming3 why d'ye shout at me?

and thereafter died by drowning himself.G
