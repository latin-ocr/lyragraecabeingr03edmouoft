ARCHILOCHUS

pauiment of a sort of lyre, the ιάμβύκη. The κλεψιά,ιιβος1
accompanied it also, but with this the vocal delivery was
something halfway between singing and speaking, appar-
ently resembling the spoken part of a modern comio
song, where the performer merely speaks in time with tho
musm.

For the origin of the' art-use of the Iambic it is
important to note that ARCHILOCHUS belonged to
a family of hereditary priests of Demeter.

It is well known how in his anger at being refused the
hand of the daughter of a Parian noble he attacked the
whole family in an Iambic poem which he sang 01· recited
at the festival of Demeter, producing such an effect that
the daughters of Lycambes‚ whose character the verses
called in question, were believed to have hanged themselves
for shame.

Clearly, like the Hymns in the contests at Delphi
in honour of Apollo, Iambic song-poems were the
subjects of poetico-musical competitions at Paros in
honour of Demeter. The sequel may indeed have
done something to bring the Iambic Trimeter into
more than local or ritual use among the professional
poets of Greece3 but the ancient belief that Archilo-
chus invented it, in view of the complete metrica]
identity of his lines with those of the Attio tragedy
of 150 years later, is extremely unlikely. He was
also said to have invented the combination of unlike
rhythms. This in view of the M caryites can be only
partly true.

‘To him also’ says Plutarch 2‘ are ascribed the Epode,
the Tetrameter, the Cretic, the Pr'osodia0, and the lengthen-
ing of the Dactylic Hexameter (e. q. in heptameters and
octameters); by some also the Elegiac ’——and so on,
referring to his new metrical combinations‚ and then—-
‘ the practice of reciting some of the Iambics to the
instrument (λέγεσθαι παρὰ τὴν κροῦσιν) and Singing
others ⁹—and a little further on—‘ he is also thought to
have invented τὴν κροῦσιν τὴν ὑπὸ τὴν ᾠδήν, or playing a

1 used also for accompany ing what were probably Melie
Monodies of Alcman (see p. 617) 2 that' is to say, the author
of the De BIusica (ξ 28)
