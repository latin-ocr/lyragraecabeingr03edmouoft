ORIGINS OF CHORAL MELIC

for in both, the first metrical element or line is divisible
into two parts by thc caesura.

If the Refrain, the ‘ Epode,’ originated as we have
suggested, whence arose the other part of the stanza ‘2

Apparently from the leader's part. In the Dirge for
Hector in the Iliad, the speeches of Hecuba, Andromache,
and Helen are as it were the leader's parts, and the wails
of the women which follow each of thern the choric or
refrain element; in the earlier half of the same ritual
performance, the leader’s part is the lament of the minstrels,
and the chorio part again the wails of the women.1 The
dropping of the dancing chorus as it is dropped in Demo-
docus' κλέα ἇνδρῶν (but not in the Lay of Ares and
Aphrodite) gives us monodic poetry3 and this pedigree
would seem to indicate that all monodic Greek ‘ art-
poetry,’ whether Epic, Elegiae, Iambic‚ or Melic, was in
origin choral. But in some cases the ritual element
resisted the tendency to make the performance a mere
entertaimnent‚ and the dancing chorus, so far from
being dropped, became more and more important, even-
tually taking to itself the leader's part (or the two leaders'
parts) as well as the refrain.

This was the birth both of the Triadic arrangement,
for instance of Attio drama, and of the Strophio
arrangement, for instance of some of Pindar's
Epinicia‚ the former a combination of the refrain
or epode with two amoebeic leader's parta the latter
a fusion of it with a sinqle leader’s part.

It is significant here that the refrain often extends in
Attic tragedyinto a little strophe of three or four lines,
for instance ἐπὶ δὲ τῷ τεθυμένῳ κτλ., Aesch. Eum. 321-
3463 and that the last line of the familiar Sapphic stanza
was called the Adonian‚ being metrically identical in all
probability with the refrain of the Adonis-Song. There
is nothing to show, as is sometimes held, that the Strophio
arrangement is older than the Triadic.

The choral cult song-dance, then, which emerges
into the art-sphere in the latter half of the 7 th Century,
had an immemorial past behind it.

² whether or no this passage is a late addition, it is sufficiently
ancient evidence for our purpose
