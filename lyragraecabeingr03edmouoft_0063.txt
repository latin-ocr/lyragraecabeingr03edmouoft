Plutarch Elusio: Among those of his own age
Aristoxenus declares that it fell to the lot of Telesias
of Thebes to be educated in his youth in the best
music, and to learn the works of famous artists,
particularly of Pindar, Dionysius of Thebes, Lamprus,
Pratinas, and the rest, in fact all of the lyrie poets
who were good composers of musio.l

Plato ὒΙεηετεηιις [SocuATEs and MENEXENth]:
ΜΕΝ Whom do jou mean? surely Aspasia, don’t
you. ³—Soc. Yes, 1 do, and Connus son of &lettobius
These are my two teachelqs Aspasia of rhetoric and
Connus of music. No wonder that a man can speak
with such an education. Yet even a man who was
not so well educated, but who owed his music to
Lamprus and his rhetoric to Antiphon of Rhamnus‚
would be able to win himself fame by eulogising
Athenians at Athens.

Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner: Another water·
drinker was Lamprus the musieian, of whom Phryni-
chus says that ‘ the sea-mews among whom Lamprus
died sing his dirge,2 the water-drinker, the whining
highbrOW, the Muses' mummy, the nightingales’
ague,3 the hymn in honour of Death.’
