CORINNA

accorded tenth place in the ‘ canon ² 01 Greek Lyric
Poets, there is fortunately more to say. Apart from
her famous reproof 01 1116 young Pindar (above,
p. 6), and his as famous but less courteous reference
to her rusticity (above, p. 8), little is known 01
COR1NNA beyond what may be gathered from the
few extant fragments 01 her work. She was born at
Tanagra3 she perhaps lived part 01 11611116 at Thebes3
she was five times victorious over Pindar3 she took
Pindar to task in a poem 101· using an Attic word3
she wrote ‘ five Books, and Inscriptions, and Lyric
Nomes.’ She was moreover a pupi] 01 611 otherwise
almost unknown lyric poetess Myrtis 01 Anthedon,
who wrote at least one poem, known to Plutarch, on
a local Tanagraean myth, resembling in subject the
love-tales 01 Stesichorus and in general type the
stories sung by Corinna herself.

To judge by her editor's orthography, which cannot
be earlier than the 4th Century, the edition in which tho
Alexandrians apparently found Corinna's works was made
long after her day. It throws light on the provincial, or
should we say national, character 01 her work compared
with Pindar’s, that it was not ‘ metagrammatised ’ like
his into the new Attic alphabet‚ but into its offshoot
the new Boeotian. The edition was probably made by a
Theban schoolmaster soon after the battle 01 Leuctra, ’
when the national pride 01 the Boeotians ran high.

In the extant part of what appears to be the
introductory poem to her Old-Wives’ Tales, of which
there were perhaps two or more Books, she sings
‘ for, ον 10, 1116 white-robed daughters 01 Tanagra '3
but whether this means that they were the per·
formers as choruses 01 maidens or merely the audience
which she chiefly had in view, is not clear. Her
subjects seem to be mainly the local myths 01
Boeotia, often taken, as her title plainly tells, from
the lips 01 1116 people, and told not without charm
in a singularly plain and simple way nearer kin to
the Fable than to the Epos. There is some small
trace 01 persona] poetry, but this may belong to the
persona] part 01 Choral works.
