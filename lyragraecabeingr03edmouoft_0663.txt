BACCHYLI DES

Pindar but unlike Simonides, were ascribed Processionals
and Parthenez'a. But we must remember that these
classifications owe much to Alexandria; and in any case
it is clear that the themes of these three poets and the
treatment of their themes were closely akin. Hence
partly no doubt the rivalry between the two Ionians
and the Aeolo-Dorian; hence also perhaps in some degree
their excellence.

Yet we may believe they were far from equal.

‘ Bacchylides and Ion may be faultless‚ may have
attained to complete mastery of the smooth or polishcd
style, whereas there are times when Pindar and Sophocles

And now for Bacchylides we can agree. Bacchy-
lides' eagle, his ghosts beside Cocytus, his flowers of
Victory around the altar of Zeus, are fine delicately
conceived pieces of imaginative writing; but they
do not bring water to the eyelid like Simonides’
Thermopylae nor, like Pindar's three-word apo-
calypses, stir thoughts too deep for tears. Our
mind’s eye may delight in Bacchylides, our heart
goes out to Simonides. Bacchylides' material was
the same as Pindar's‚ but his treatment of it, as far as
we can judge, much less original. His myths, bothin
style and structure, bear a closer kinship to the
Epos, or rather perhaps to the Lyre-Sung Nome
that had long taken its place in narrative song. His
tale has more of the novel than Pindar's and less of
the short story. He is more concerned with the
facts of a victory than with its meaning. With him
gnomic commonplace is not transmuted into pro-
phetie utterance. He is more of the professional
song-writer who entertains‚ less of the inspired
prophet who needs must teach. He might (almost)
have written some of the 4th Pythian ,· he could never
