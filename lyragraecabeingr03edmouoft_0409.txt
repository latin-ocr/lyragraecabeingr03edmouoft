THE DITHYRAMBS OF PHILOXENUS

wizard am Ι, who may prove a welcome aid to thee in thy so
unsuccessful sea love-making. Ι know incantations and
binding charms and philtres which Galat-ea can hardly
withstand even for a little while. Only do thou engage to
move the door aside- or rather this doorstone, which seemeth
to me a very promontory—and Ι will subdue the maid and
rejoin thee quicker than the saying of it. Subduc? nay, Ι
will show thee herself lured hither by many a charm; and
she shall be thy suppliant, and thou shalt play coy dissembler.
Yet this much giveth me thought, lest the smell of the goat
in the fleeces disturb a maid that lives softly and washeth
herself many times a day. It were well then that thou
shouldst both put all in order and sweep and wash and
fumigate thy chamber, and better still if thou preparedst
crowns of ivy and woodbine to crown thyself and thy love
withal. O why tarriest thou? puttest thou not thy hand
e'en now to the door ‘2' Atthis Polyphemus burst out laugh-
ing his very loudest and clapped his hands together3 and
odysseus thought he was in transports of joy at the expecta-
tion that his love should be his. But Polyphemus only
chucked him under the chin and said ‘ Noman‚ thou seem'st
to be a mighty shrewd manikin and well versed in the affairs
of life ; but now thou must fain broider thee a different robe,
for from this place thou shalt not escape.' Odysseus, who
was truly being wronged, was in the event, we know, to get
the advantage in knavery. But you, who are a Cyclops in
strength and a Sisyphus in attempt, are caught by J ustice
and held fast by Law, both of which you perhaps despise.
Yet if you must overcome the laws altogether, I only hope I
may not be the one to undo them and break down the door
of the prisoner's hold . . .

Hesychius Glossary: μεσαύχενες ‘Mid-necked' 2—Aristo-
phanes says ‘wineskins‚ those mid-necked corpses.’ It is to
be written so with the letter μ, μεσαύχενες, because the cord
tied round it squeezes the neck of the wineskin in the middle.
He is parodying the phrases of Philoxenus in the Syrian.
Some authorities, however, write it with the δ, δεσαύχενες

‘tie-necked' and also <iu the form βυσαύχενες ‘bung-
necked'>, but incorrectly.
