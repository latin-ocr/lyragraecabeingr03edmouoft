RITUAL SONG-DANCE OUTSIDE THE EPIC

exhortation with its offshoot ‘ moralising,’ that is general
reflexion on men and things (these new topics and their
traditional metrical associations led the way to the
personal poem of which we find examples even in Archilo-
chus, and to the personal element in the Choral Melie such
as Alcman’s Partheneionn (3) the resuscitation, as an
art-form, of the song-dance.

Apart from the evidence of Homer, Hesiod‚ and the
Homeric Hymns, there is much to show that ritual
song-dance had long existed in Greece.

The Megarians used to send a chorus of fifty youths
and maidens to Corinth whenever one of the Bacchiad
family died. This was not only the family of Archias
founder of Syracuse (7 40 B.C.) but one of the Spartan royal
famffies, and therefore very ancient. Singers and dancers
are figured on a ‘ Dipylon ’ bowl. This Dipylon pottery,
found at Athens, belongs to the 9th 01· 8th Century. We
may compare too the Elean women's Hymn to Dionysus,
and with it a passage of Pausanias (5. 16. 6) about the
Heraean women’s games or competitions: ‘ The Sixteen
Women (chosen two from each tribe) also get up two
choruses, one called the chorus of Physcoa‚ the other the
choi-us o’f Hippodameia. This Physcoa‚ they say, was a
native of the Vale of Elis who bore Diony sus a son
Nareaeus, and she and her son were the first to worship
Dionysus.’ These were no doubt chor-uses of women.
Herodotus speaks of ancient invective choral song-dances
of women at Aegina. There are also the Attic τρυγῳδοί or
vintage-singers, from which came Attic comedy‚ and the
τραγικοὶ χοροί held in honour of Adrastus at Sicyon.

Ritual song· -dance, then, was very ancient; yet
apart f1 om prehistoric figures such as 01011,110 do not
hear of it in connexion with what 110 may call pro-
fessional poets till Eumelus, and after him 111010 is
a gap of a century. Nor do we find it, in its‘ pre-
art ' stage, connected with any particular God.
When, however, it emerges as an art-form in the 8th
and 7th CenturieS‚ we find it associated with Apollo.

This is natural enough; for the only professional poetry

up to that time had been connected with the worship of ’

Apollo and the Muses, and the only known periodic
competition of poets which we can call prehistoric is the
contest which Pausanias tells us was founded at Delphi in
