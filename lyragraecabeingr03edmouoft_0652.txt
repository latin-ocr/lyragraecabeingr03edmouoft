AN ACREON

for the first time a certain sign of the spread of the new-
Lesbian infiuence, the Choriamb. The same influence is
probably to be traced in the personal note that sounds
in the beautiful fragments of the Love-Poems which
made his chief claim to immortality. It is clear that in
losing Ibycus we have lost much, perhaps even a ‘ male
Sappho.’ Whether these Love-Poems were Monodies we
do not know. Some of them certainly contained myths.
But human nature as well as the Aeolian connexion makes
it unlikely that they were all Choral. If the authorship
of Stesichorus’ Funeraz Games of Pelias was sometimes
attributed to him, it would seem probable that Ibycus
wrote similar narrative poems, some of which may have
been Monodic. The triadic arrangement of the poem
dedicated (or dedicatory) to Polycrates would seem to
imply that it was performed by a· chorus as an Encomium
or Eulogy, a development aof the κῶμος of which we have
already had examples—but Monodic examples-in Alcaeus.
Some of the Leve-Songs were probably of the same type.
We hear of no Hymns or Paeans, though we have one
mention of a Dit-hyramb. Of this we shall speak later.

The dedication to Polycrates is to be noted as a
persona] ending to a Choral and impersonal song.
It marks the growing tendency to employ art-choral
to honour an individual, a tendency which appears

ξιφὲ in the Eulogies and Epinicia of Simonides and
in ar.

The new-Lesbian infiuence is very clearly marked
in the fragments of a poet who sang at the same
court. The long lise of the Ionian ANACREON,

beginning before the middle of the 6th Century,
continued well into the 5th.

He probably died at Athens about 488. Aeschylus’ first
tragedy was staged in 499. Anacreon's life seems to have
been spent at his birthplace Teos, at Abdera whither
he went with his countrymen when they emigrated to
Thrace rather than submit to the Persians, at the court
of Polycrates at Samos, at Athens at the court of the
Peisistratsds‚ at the house of the Thessalian noble
Echecratidas, and again at Athens under the democracy.

Antiquity seems to have possessed his works in
five Books, the first three probably comprising his
