‘ NEW ’-LESBIAN FORMS

Iambics‚ probably including Trochaics; but whether these
were plain trimeters and tetraincters or combinations such
as we find in Archilochus, we do not know.

One of the outstanding features of the new Aeolic verse
is the entire absence of resolution and of groups of three
short syllables. It can hardly therefore derive from the
same source as the Paeon (vvv—), which was Cretan, nor
as the Choree or Tribrach (vvv) which was Phrygian.
Another peculiarity is the Choriamb (-vv— ). The ‘ true '
Choriamb‚ composed as it were 1 of a Dactyl plus an extra-
long syllable, occurs only in Asclepiad metres. It is
equivalent to two bars, or one-and-two-thirds bars, of
three-time.2 In Glyconics and kindred metres the
presence of the Choriamb is merely a question of syllable-
division; it may be there, but it is not necessary to
postulate it. The Iom'c rhythms involving the feet νν- -
and --νη as their name suggests, are something quite
different. The Ionic, like the Molossus (-— — — ), is equivalent
to one bar of three— time. This, and perhaps the Gly conic‚
occur in Alcman. These metres may therefore have
come earlier than the others into Lesbian art· -poetriyIi
Whatever their ultimate source, the Ionio certainlyst
view of its name, and the Glyconic probably, because of
its so frequent use by Anacreon, came through Ionian
channels. The ‘ Sapphic ' stanza with its ‘ epode ’ called
Adonian, which occurs in the refrain of the Elean Hymn
to Dionysus, in the cry ὦ ἴτε Βάκχαι in Euripides, and
in one form of the refrain of the Paean, ὦ ἴε παιάν, and
the Asclepiads, used by Sappho in a choral song involving
question and answer between a girl· choir and Cytherea,
point to connexion certainly with folk- hymns, perhaps
with a traditional Adonis· Song. The Glyconic (of which
Alcman’ s 130. 5 is an uncertain example, as it follows two
iambic dimeters), in view of Catullus’ Epithalamium in
the Gly conic- Pherecratio stanza‚ certain similar hymeneal
fragmeynts of Sappho and Euripides (Troad. 323 ff.,) and
the rhythm of the Wedding refrain, ὦ ὑμὴν ὑμέναιε, may
perhaps be derived from an even more ancient Marriage-
song. The worship of Adonis, mentioned first by Hesiod,
seems to have come from Sem’itio sources through Cyprus-
