THE LYRE—SUNG NOME

We have a considerable fragment of his :ir-qo, in which
he speaks up for the use of the fiute, possibly in reply to
Melanippides’ Marsyas, which dealt with the contest
between flute and lyre.

Towards the end of this period the ever-growing
desire for mere entertainment caused a revival of
interest in an old but not obsolete 1 form, the Lyre-
Sung Nome‚ This revival was due to the Lesbian
Phrynis‚ who won his first Athenian victory in 446,
and his pupil Timotheus of Miletus, who lived at
Athens and was a friend of Euripides, and died at
a great age in 357.

This ancient song was accompanied by a dancing, and
sometimes in the earlier period singing (Plut. Mus. 8,
Procl. Chrest. 320a. 33), chorus, to the tune, traditionally‚
of the lyre; but even in the time of Terpander the lyre
was supported in a subordinate position by the flute.
When the share of the chorus came to be confined habitually
to the dancing, the song was left a Lyric Monody with
orchestic accompaniment‚ a type which had the advantage
over other Choric song that the words could be heard
more easily by the audience. That this was felt to be a
real advantage to it as an entertainment is clear not only
from the way in which Epic, Iambic and Elegiae all
became recitation-verse‚ but from the passage of the
Froqs where Aristophanes takes credit to himself for
supplying his audience with books of the words for the
coming contest between Aeschylus and Euripides.² It
is no coincidence that the same period in the history of
Melic poetry saw Philoxenus’ introduction of solos into the
Dithyramb. .

To judge by the large fragment of Timotheus’ Persae,
the style of the ‘ new ’ Nome‚ despite the distinction drawn
by Proelus,³ differed little from that of the later
Dithyramb, with which indeed it was probably intended
to compete for popular favour. The Persae is directed, in
its ‘seal ' or personal part, the part in which the author

1 the ‘ Boeotian ' Nome was still performed at Athens in 426,
Ar. Ach. 13 ff. 2 there, of course, it is the spoken, not the
sung, word that they wished to be able to follow, but the inference
to the attitude of the late-5th-Century playgoer at Athens is
clear3 see also p. 633 ³ below, p. 676
