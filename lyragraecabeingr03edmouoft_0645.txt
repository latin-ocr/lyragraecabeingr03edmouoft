A CHANGED OUTLOOK

preserved features both of the songs the early Greek
colonists had brought with them to Lesbos, and of
those they had found there when they came.

The causes of this incorporation, whether it was
made by Sappho and Alcaeus or, what is more likely,
their immediate but unknown 1 predecessors, are to be
looked for in changing circumstances and a changing
outlook. For one thing, the introduction of coinage
had but recently given its great stimulus to commerce,
and the accumulation of wealth had begun to give
men freer cormnand of the labour 01⁰ their fellows.
This showed itself not only in the multiplication of
⁶ tyrannies ' throughout Greece, but in the conflicts
between nobles and commons, as for instance at
Mytilene. Sappho, who was banished by the demo-
cratic dictator Pittacus, was of high birth, and her
husband a very rich man who came from Andros:
her brother accumulated enough wealth as a trader
in wine to buy the notorious courtesan Doricha ‘ at
a high price.’ It is natural in such circumstances—-
in Greece—that poets should get more to do. We
may believe that ritual song-dance, particularly if,

' as it often was, it was competitive‚ gave opportimity

for the display of wealth. Weaith made the indi-
vidual, with his greater command of others’ hands,
a greater person than his neighbours, a more im-
portant wheel in the machine of state. This feeling
of importance woqu seem to have expressed itself in
art—patronage, and fostered a demand for poetic
praise of men as well as of Gods.

The first port-rait statue—of a victorious Spartan
athlete at Olympia—appears in 628, the first En-
comium among the fragments of Alcaeus. These
Eulogies were doubtless a development of an old
feasting-custom not unconnected with the Homeric
‘ renowns of men ’ on the one hand and the ritual
Libation-Song on the other. The Love-Song, found,
as we have seen, already in Alcman, was a specialised
development, we may take it, of the same originals ;
