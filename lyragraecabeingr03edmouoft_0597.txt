From a Papyrus of the 3rd Cent. 13.C. ε

F ill the bowl of the Graces brimming, and drink
a health in a covert saying. Proclaim that with
countless praises of maidens we will garland the
Troy that was ravaged by the throwing of a spem·
at a prowling spy who was taken beside bhe

immemorable ships.3

From the Same :

O mild-eyed Mother of the Muses, follow thou a
pure offspring of thy children. Freshly blooming is
the song we bring, made motley with new-fashioned
skill. [The ship] is wet with the dews of Achelofisss
Pass thou no further by the shore, man, let go the
sheet, slacken thy linen wings, make haste to the
smooth-pebbled beach. 'Tis well. Look at 'che sea3
escape ashore from ’the sore and awful frenzy of the
ocean-ranging Southwind.
