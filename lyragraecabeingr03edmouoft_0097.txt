BACCHYLI DES

LIFE

Strabo Geograplzy: Ceos had originally four cities,
but now has two, Iiilis and Carthaea, with which
the others were combined, Poieessa with Carthaea
and Coresia with Iiilis. Iulis was the birthplace
of the lyric poet Simonides and of his nephew
Bacchylides,1 and later of the physician Erasistratus
and the Peripatetic philosopher Ariston. There
appears to have been a law here, mentioned by
Menander in the lines ‘The Cean custom takes my
fancy still, Ι The man who can't live well shall
not live ill,’ whereby in order to make the supplies
go round, all citizens who reached the age of sixty
should drink the hemlock.2

Plutarch Exile: The ancients, too, it seems, wrote
the finest and most famous of their works with the
aid of Exile. Thucydides the Athenian composed
his history of the war between the Peloponnese
and Athens near Scapte Hyle in Thrace, Xenophon

wrote at Scyllus in Elis . . ., the poet Bacchylides
in the Peloponnese.

Eusebius Chrouicle: Olympiad 78. 3 (3.0. 466):
Flourished Bacchylides and Diagoras the atheist.3
