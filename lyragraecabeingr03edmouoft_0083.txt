DIAGORAS

him contains no single word of impiety, but shows the proper
reverence of a poet for things divine. Ι need quote only the
poem

To AmANTHEs OF Anaosl

'Tis God, ’tis God who wieldeth his mind supreme
ere every mortal deed is done; and short is the
journey Prowess can go of herself 3

and the ode

To Nicooonus or MANTlNEA

F All mortal achievement is according to God and
ortune.2

{Iestpnony no less strong will be found in his Euloyy of
¹an mea.

Invited one day to dinner by another philosopher he was left
alone with the boiling lentils while his host left the room,
and finding that they could not boil because the fire laeked
fuel, ran about in search of it, till espying near-by the statue
of Heracles he broke it up and put it in the fire with the
following words :

To his twelve labours Heracles the Divine has
added a thirteenth.4
