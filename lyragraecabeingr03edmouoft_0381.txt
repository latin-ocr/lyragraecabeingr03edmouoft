LIFE OF PHILOXENUS OF CYTHERA

Dionysius of Halicarnassus Literary Compositionz
The older lyric poets, by which I mean Alcaeus
and Sappho, wrote in short stanzas3 their few lines
admitted but few variations, and they used the
epode very sparingly. Poets like Stesichorus and
Pindar, however, made their sentences longer and
distributed them among many metres and lines
simply from a desire for variety. The dithyramb-
writers went further. They varied the styles, using
Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian in one and the same
poem3 modulated the melodies, making them at
one time enharmonio, at another chromatio, and at
another diatonic; and persisted in doing what they
liked with the rhythms. This is true at least of
the school of Philoxenus, Timotheus and Telestes;
with its earlier exponents the dithyramb was of
regular shape. Prose, on the other hand, enjoys
complete freedom to adorn its structure with all
the variations it chooses.
