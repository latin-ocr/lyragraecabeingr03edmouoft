SIMONIDES

Hipparchus was LAsus of Hermione in Argolis,
Melie poet, teachcr of the lyre, and musical theorist.l
He seems indeed to have been the first writer on the
theory of music, to have improved the lyre by giving it a
more extensive and more finely divided scale, and to have
given new life to the Dithyramb—whose historyis reserved
for a later page—both by enlarging its metrical and tonal
scope, and by making its performance competitive.

He clearly had much to do, after the fall of the
Peisistratids‚ with the extension or institution of the
intertribal contests in music and poetry by which
Cleisthenes sought to establish his constitution in
the affections of the people.

Though his Choral poetry seems to have survived into
the Alexandrian age, we have only the first three lines of
his H ymn to the H ermionian Demeter, and references, both

of which throw doubt on their genuineness, to an asig-
-matic ode entitled The Centaure and a Book of Dithy-

rambs.

His later reputation may be measured by his
having been accorded a place among the Seven VVise
Men, and his contemporary fame by Pindar's flute-
master's choice of him to instruct his pupil in the

lyre.

A then somewhat similar but now far more famous
figure in the Athenian life of that day is the first
Pan-Hellenic poet, SIMONIDES.

Born about 555, he seems to have spent his youth and
early manhood in his birthplace‚ the Ionian island of
Ce0s; then to have lived under the patronage of Hippar-
chus at Athens; and after the fall of the Peisistratids to
have migrated to Thessaly, where he lived with one or
other of the great nobles. In the year 506 or soon after,
he wrote an Epitaph for the Athenians who died in the
operations against Chalcis, and early in the new century
accepted the new order and returned to Athens to live
under the democratic regime.

1 it is significant that the first ancient system of musical
notation was founded on an old Argivo alphabet, and that
Lasus‘ t-heoretical studies were shared by the Pythagorean
Hippasus of Metapontum
