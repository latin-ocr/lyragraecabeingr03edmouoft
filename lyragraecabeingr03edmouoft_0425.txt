TELLES, TELLEN, ΟΒ TELLIS

who resembles me; nobody resembles me but Orestes3
therefore it is he.' And there is the recognition of Iphigeneia
in Polyidus the sophist, where Orestes naturally infers that
as his sister has been sacrificed so he must now share her

fate.

The Same : Subjects already invented should nevertheless
be sketched out in general by the poet himself before being
arranged in episodes and worked out in detail. He should
investigate the general plan, for example, of an Iph-iyeneia
thus :—A young girl has been sacrificed and has then
mysteriously vanished from the sight of her sacrificers and
been transported to a country where it is customary to
sacrifice all strangers to the God, and there become priesteSS.
Some time afterwards her brother happens to art-ive.there.
The fact that he has been sent there by the oracle for some
reason, the purpose of his coming, is outside the story.
However‚ he comes, is seized‚ and is about to be sacrificed,
when he makes the recognit-ion. This may be either in the
manner of Euripides or of Poly'1'dUS‚ who makes him say very
naturally that it was not only his sister, then, who was to
perish by sacrifice—a remark which sares his life.

Plutarch Sayinys of Kingss [Epaminondas]: When news
was brought him that the Athenians had sent a newly-
equipped army into the Peloponnese‚ he said ‘What of it?
Does Antigeneidas weep and wail when Telles gets a new
pair of pipes?’ Now Telles was as bad a fluteplayer as
Antigenidas was a good one.

Zenobius Proverbs : Sing the songs of Tellen :—the proverb
is used of moekers or jesters. Tenen was a fiuteplayer and
lyric poet who left some sportive verse of excellent rhythm
and remarkable charm, and some extremely witty jests.

The Same: This Tellen was a fluteplayer and a writer of
ffiiggsgffiggous lyrica, who is mentioned by Dicaearchus the

Ptolemy son of Hephaestion: When Demetrius of Scepsis
died, a copy of the works of Tenis was found beside his pillow.
