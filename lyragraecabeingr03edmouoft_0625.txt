THE LYRE

It is not to be supposed that cult song-danccs like the
Wedding-Song, Olen’s Dance-song to Artemis, and the
Dirge for Linus, were impromptu performances; and it is
to them more than to the Hymn that we should probably
look for the origins of the Choral Melie which comes to
light in the 7th Century.

The instrumente employed in Chora] Melie were
both lyre and fiute3 in Monodic the lyre, except in
the Flute-sung Nome, which seems to have been
accompam'ed by a dancing chorus.

The most usual word for the lyre in Homer is φόρμιγξ;
κίθαρις is far less common; and λύρα, χέλυς, and
βάρβιτος do not occur till later. Of these five words
all except βάρβιτος if not Greek are at any rate Indo-
European, for it does not seem impossible to connect
κίθαρις, or as it appears after Homer κιθάρα, with
κίθαρος ‘the chest (pectus),’ perhaps originally ‘breast-
bone.’ In the Border Ballad of The Two Sisters the
harper makes a harp out of the breast·bone of a drowned
maiden and strings it with her hair. This, we may believe,
though the breast-bone would hardly be a human one as a
rule, would be one type of primitive stringed instrument,
and the χέλυς or tortoiseshell the other. They would
of course retain their names long after they had come to be
made of wood. The ancients appear sometimes to have
drawn a distinction, associating the κιθάρα with Apollo
and the χέλυς or χέλυννα with Hermes. The player
Of the Linus-Song in Homer iS said φόρμιγγι κιθαρίζειν,
which seems 120 show that φόρμιγξ and κίθαρις were
identical to Homer’s audience. The word λύρα is first
found in Archilochus. βάρβιτος and χέλυς perhaps be-
longed originally to the Aeolio side of Greek Melic‚
κιθάρα to the Ionio. The ‘ Lydian ' pectis was probably
new to Greece in Sappho’s day. The differences of name
doubtless represent, in most cases, differences in form and
in tonal range and pitch.

The reconstitution of the musico-poetical com·
petitions at Delphi in 586 was due, no doubt, to new
influences. One of these was clearly a ‘ boom‚' as
we should say, in fiuteplaying, which is to be con-
nected with the spread of Elegiae poetry3 another
was probably the spread of Aeolian Melie.
