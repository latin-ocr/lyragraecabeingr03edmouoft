THE DITHYRAMBS OF PHILOXENUS

13 1 Epi‘rHALAMY

Athenaeus Doctors αι Βίηηεν [on gluttony]: The same
story² is told of Philoxenus of C> thera . . . According to
Clearchus, whether at home or abroad Philoxenus used to
take a bath and then v isit other people s houses acoompanied
by slaves carrying oil‚ wine, caviare, x inegar and other kinds
of seasoning, dress with the required seas oning whatev er was
cooking for the owners, and then sink down exhausted and
make a good meal on the spot. It was Philoxenus who 011
his arrival at Ephesus found the fishmonger’s empty, and
being informed, when he asked the reason, that all the fish

had been bought up for a wedding, took a bath and went
uninv ited to the bridegroom' s. W hen supper was ov er he

sang—he was a dithyramb- writer—a wedding- -song, that
which begins

O Marriage, most famous of Gods,

and captivated all hearts. then the bridegroom said ‘ You
must sup here to-morrow too, Philoxenus,' he rejoined ‘ I
will, if the good things aren’t sold meanwhile.'

The Same [on wine]: Compare Philoxenus of Cythera :

fair-flowing musical wine

Antigonus of Cary stus Uarrcls: According to the Delphi-
ans, at certain times the Corycian cave on Mount Parnassus
shines like gold. And so we must not suppose Philoxenus
to be speaking metaphorically when he say s:

They themselves over Parnassus into the gold-
roofed chamber of the Nymphs . . .
