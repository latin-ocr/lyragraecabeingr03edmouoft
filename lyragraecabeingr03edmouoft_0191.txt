Graces or is versed in divination, another bendeth
a wily bow at pelf, others again exalt· their spirits
upon works of the field and with herds of kine.1
The future brings forth issues inscrutable3 we know
not on which side Fortune’s scale will sink. The
fairest of things is, that a good man be envied much
of many, albeit I know the great power also of
wealth, which turneth to account even the unprofit-

fail to take μακράν with γλῶσσαν; Bacchylides uses γλῶσσα
33. 195 for a song or story, when he ‘sends a tongue' to

drift of the sentence is clear, but restoration doubtful
because the (dead, cf. l. 3) father-’s name was almost certainly

is short for e. 9. Aglaophemus‚ his father's might well be a
compound of the same adj.
