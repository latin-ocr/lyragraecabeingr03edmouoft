HERMOLOCHUS(Q

loved beauty Atarneus' nurslingl hath made the
sun’s light desolate. Therefore shall the Daughters
of Memory cry him famous for his deeds and to live
evermore, and magnif-v the God of Host and Guest
and extol true friendship.

Now Ι (10 not know whether anyone can see anything here
characteristic of the paean. The writer clearly admits that
Hermeias is dead . . ., and there is no paeanic refrain as
there is 111 the real paean to the Spartan Lysander which, in
his book entitled Anuals of Samos, Duris declares is sung
in that city . . . And moreover Aristotle says himself, in

his Desence from the Accusat-ion of Impiely—-if the speech is
genuine—“If I had intended to sacrifice to Hermeias as an
immortal being Ι should not have built him the tomb of a
mortal, nor if I had wished to make him a God should Ι have

honoured his remains with funeral obsequies.'² ’

HERMOLocHUs(v

Stobaeus Antkoloqy [that life is short. of· little account,
and full of care]: Hermoloehus : ²

All life is inscrutable‚ wandering amid events with
nothing sure. 'Tis hope cheers on the heart3 no
man born knoweth certainly whither he goes3 and
often enough there bloweth a dire wind contrary to
success, Yet in danger and calamity God is ever at
the helm.

¹ Hermeias ² or Hermolaus ; called Hermolochus by
stobaeus ap. Phot. Bibl. 167 (p. 117 init. Bek.) ; hardly to be
identified with the Hermodotus of Plut. Is. et Os. 24, Stob.

Fl. 60. 3, still less with the Hermocles of Ath. 15. 697 a,
6. ‘253 b3 it may well come within the scope of this book
