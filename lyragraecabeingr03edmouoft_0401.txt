THE DITHYRAMBS OF PHILOXENUS

Aelian Aliscellanies : The Sicilian stone-quarries were
situated near Epipolas, and measured two hundred yards
by sixty. Some of the prisoners they contained had been
there so long that they had married and got children within
them, and among these were not a few who having never set
eyes on a town were so amazed when they went into Syracuse
and saw teams of horses driven by shouting drivers that they
fied shrieking away. The best of the caves in the quarries
was known as that of the poet Philoxenus, being the quarters
in which he snapped his fingers at the punishment meted out

to him by Dionysius, and so effectu ely courted the Muse in
the midst of his sufferings as to compose 111 that prison his
finest lyric poem The Cyclops.

Hermesianax Leontium [from a catalogue of love-affairs]:
And the man from Cythera, whom Athens nursed and bred
to be the M uses’ most loyal steward oi Bacchus and the flute‚
to wit Philoxenus, well thou knowest, Leontium, what was
the wound he suffered at Ortygia ere 110 passed through this
city, ² for thou wottest of the great love whe1 ewlth Galatea
inspired e’ en her sheep· attendants.2

Scholiast on Theocritus ι According to Duris, Polyphemus
built a temple to Galatea on the side of Etna because of the
excellent pasturage and the abundant supply of milk, but
Philoxenus of Cythera, living there and so being unable to
give a fictitious reason like that, made Polyphemus the
lover of Galatea.

Didymus on Demosthenes: ‘The man who came from
Macedonia was so willing to take risks that in his desire to
extend his rule he became maimed for life in battle against
his enemies’ :.— . It was at the siege of Methone that
Philip lost his right eye by an arrow while 110 was inspecting
the siege· engines. . . The story of the fluteplay er is
accepted, among other historianS, by Marsyas. It seems
that at a musical competition hel'd by Philip a short time
before the loss of his eye, all the competing fluteplayers, by
a strange coincidence, performed the Cyclops, Antigeneides
that of Philoxenus, Chrysogonus that of Stesichorus, and
Timotheus that of Oeniades.
