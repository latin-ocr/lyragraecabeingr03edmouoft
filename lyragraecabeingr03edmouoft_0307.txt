LIFE OF TIMOTHEUS

of Pieria added the ninth, Histiaeus of Colophon the
tenth, Timotheus of Miletus the eleventh, and so on
to the eighteenth.1

Clement of Alexandria illisi-ellani& z The first man
to set poems to music was Terpander of Antissa, who
thus dealt with the laws of Sparta ; 2 the Dithyranib
was invented by Lasus of Hermione ; the Hymn by
Stesichorus of Himera; the Choral dance by Alcman
of Sparta 3 Love-poems by Anacreon of Teos ;
dancing the Hyporcheme by Pindar of Thebes3 and
Ν omes were first sung to dance and lyre by Timotheus
of Miletus.

Plutarch illusio: The Lyre-sung Nome was
established long before the F lute-sung, in the days
of Terpander . . . Terpander composed Lyre-sung
Proems in epic verse, and it is clear that the ancient
Lyre-sung Nomes were of this nature from the
practice of Timotheus, who sang his first nomes in
hexameters with an intermixture of dithyrambic
phraseology, so that he might conceal at the outset
his sins against the musical tradition.

Proclus Chrestomalhy: The Nome is in honour of
Apollo and takes its name srom his appellation
Nomius.3 The ancients used to make choi-uses and
sing the Nome to flute or lyre, but Chrysothemis the
Cretan first adopted a distinctive dress, and taking a
lyre in his hand to represent Apollo, sang a nome
solo, and as he became famous for this performance

285): the seventh and the ninth are ascribed to T. by
[Censorin.] Gram. Lac. 6. 610, and the ninth by Pliny N. H.
7. 57 ² perh. a confusion between the two meanings of
νόμος, ‘law’ and ‘norne,' but cf. Plut. Sol. 3 ³ the
etymology is prob. incorrect
