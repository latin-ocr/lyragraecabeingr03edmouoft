THE TWO LESBIANS

its sister the Epinicion or Song of Congratulation
for victory in the Games is found—but as a ‘ Hymn 2
to Heracles celebrating the poet's own success—as
early as Archilochus. To the same family doubtless
belongs the Scolion or Drinking·Song, whose origin,
as we have seen, was ascribed to Terpander.1 This
too is found in Alcman as well as in Alcaeus. Alcaeus’
Stasiotica, Political Songs, were probably separated
from his Drinking—Songs by the Alexandrian editors
merely because of their subject. We have an iambic
tetrameter in Alcaeus, and, as we saw just now,
Sappho’s eighth Book was called The Iambics.
XVhether or not the traditional metre of invective
was commonly used by both, the lampooning spirit is
in some of the Stasiotz'ca of Alcaeus and in Sappho's
lines To a W oman of No Education.

During the 7th Century the whole Greek view of
life had become more individualistic, more self-
conscious, more anaffloess Poets now sang more
about their own feelings, and addressed themselves
to the emotions of individuals as well as to those of
collective audiences. The sphere of art-activities
was enlarged to include private life. The old customs
of the feast became the proper subject of high art,
and high art took over with the customs the folk-
metres which belonged to them This is doubtless
why these new metrical forms emerged in Lesbian
poetry, and why too, though new to the world of
art, they are so remarkably archaic in colouring.
But this was not all. Archilochus is said to have
invented the custom of‘ reciting some of the Iambics
to music and singing otherS.’ Thus begins the
divorce of poetry from song. And when poetry has
once become possible apart from music, it has taken
the first step towards becoming a thing written rather
than a thing spoken. The written epitaph is to the
