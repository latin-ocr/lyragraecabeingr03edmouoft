LIFE OF CINESIAS

Lysias Defence on α Charge of Receivz'ng Bribes:
It is not right, gentlemen of the jury, that you
should condemn me at the instigation of such men
as these, who have cut such a figure in prosecutions
for impiety,1 and yet have the hardihood to accuse
others though they cannot defend their own crimes
—persons who, though they have served in fewer
campaigns than the wretched Cinesias, nevertheless
take umbrage about the interests of the State.

Aristophanes Clouds: SoanTEs:——By Zeus, you
don't seem to know that these Clouds feed number-
less sophists‚ seed prophets of Thurii, quack-phy-
sicians, feed manicured, ring-bedecked, leonine
do-nothings, feed turners and twisters of song in
the circular chorus, seed astrologica] knaves-—for
never a hand's turn of work, just because they make
verses about them.

Scholiast on the passage : ⁶ circular ' z—He is hinting
at writers like Cinesias, Philoxenus, and Cleomenes,
and means that these too are of the sophists, though
they were writers of dithyrambs; for these were
teachers of the circular choruses. He calls them
‘ turners and twisters of song' because, owing to
their compositions not keeping within the limits
of the ‘modes they have too many καμπαί οι·
‘flourishes'2 . . .—The ancients considered the
dithyrambs were the destruction of music3 later he
will attack them more bitterly [969].—‘ Turners and
twisters of song’ z—The writers of dithyrambs; for
καμπαί or ‘twistings' is the name they give to
instrumental interludes in the song.
