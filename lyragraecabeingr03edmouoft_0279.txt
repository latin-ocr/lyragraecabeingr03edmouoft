LIFE OF ClNESIAS

“What very thin hopes you seem to have built
on!l If many such get together they'll be carried
away in the flood of their own scouring.'' 2

. Now Cinesias was in fact very thin and very
tall, and Strattis has an entire play written on him,

Other writers, including Aristophanes, have fre-

poet, because he is represented to have been cari-
catured for his atheism and he is shown to have
been of that character in the speech. The words
of the orator are these: ‘1 am surprised that you
do not take it amiss that the upholder of the law
