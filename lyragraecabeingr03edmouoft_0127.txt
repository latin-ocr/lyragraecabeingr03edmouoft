BACCHYLIDES

pemon's strong hammer is dropt from the hand of
a Maimer1 who hath found his match. I feai· me
how this all shall end.—

Who and whence saith he that this man is, and
what his equipage? Comes he with a great host
under arms, or travelleth alone with his servants like
a merchant2 that wanders abroad, this man so
mighty, stout, and valiant, who hath stayed the great
strength of so many? Sure a God must speed him
for to bring the unjust to justice, for it is no light
task to come off ever free of ill. All things end in
the long run of time.—

slung to his bright shoulders a sword of ivory haft,
and either hand hath a polished javelin3 a well-
wrought Spartan bonnet is about his ruddy locks,
and a purple shirt around his breast, with a cloak of
the frieze of Thessaly; and as for his eyes, there
goes a red flash from them as of Lemnian flame ;3 a
lad is he first come to manhood, bent on the
pastimes of Ares, war and the battle-din of bronze ;
and his quest is unto splendour-loving Athens.
