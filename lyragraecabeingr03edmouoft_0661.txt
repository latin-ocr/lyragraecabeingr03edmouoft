PINDAR

The dialect is the half-Aeolian Doric of Boeotia, the
metre mainly perhaps Ionic Dimeters or Glyconics arranged
in equal strophes of five or six lines, the latter admitting
of resolution at the beginning. She wrote, we know,
Lyric Nomes, the introduct ory parts of which were
probably m Hexameters; but xx hether her other narrat ive
poems also were Monodic is not certain. The separation
of the Nomes perhaps suggests that they were not. Her
Book of Inscriptions speaks for the wide vogue of the
fashion which among the great poets seems to hav e begun
with Sappho, if not with Archilochus.

Of the local Boeotian tradition to which Myrtis and
Corinna seem to have belonged we have no other
trace. Anthes, who hailed from Myrtis' birthplace,
belongs to the Dark Age; the poetess Boeo is of
unknown date.

Corinna’s greater pupil, PINDAR, whose poems lie
beyond the scope of 131113 book, must nevertheless
find brief mention here. WVe are told that his
flute- teacher, perhaps seeing djmly that the new
Pan· Hellenism was centred, for poesy, in Athens,
thither—it would be about the year 505—-sent the
young Theban to learn the lyre. Among his teachers
was t-he great poet-musician Lasus. The lad returned
to Thebes to be rebuked by Corinna for the neglect
of ‘ myth ’ in his poemS, and to lose to her five lyric
contests; after which he lost patience with the
provincial-minded judges and called his old instructress
‘ a Boeotian sow. '

His first datable Ode, Pythian x, was written in 498
when he was twenty years of age, his latest, P Jthzan viii,
in 446 when he was sev enty- -two He seems to have liv ed
most of his life at Thebes, with occasional visits to the
various places in Greek lands to which he was called to
exercise his art of poet· -musician and chorus trainer.
