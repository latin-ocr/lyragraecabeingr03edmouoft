Rumour, to holy Ceos with a message of gracious
words, and say that Argeius hath gotten him victory
in the battle of sturdy hands, and brought to mind
all the feats which we of the sacred isle of Euxantius
have displayed with wreaths threescore and ten at
the famous neck of Isthmus, and that the native
Muse is calling up the sweet babble of the flutes and
honouring the dear son of Pantheides with strains of
victory.³
