LIFE OF PHILOXENUS SON OF ERYXIS

Scholiast on the passage : Eryxis is satirised because
he was ill-shapen and did not know how to bellave
himself.1

Plutarch Dinner-Table Problems [whether 'the
greater delicacies coine from the sea or the land] ε
Yet the best judge of the properties of a drug is to
be found in the greatest physician, and of the
artistic value of a musical performance in the
greatest connoisseur of music, and so the best critic
of a delicacy is the greatest gourmet. In such
matters as these we must not seek the decision of
Pythagoras or Xenocrates, but of Antagoras the
poet, of Philoxenus son of Eryxis, and of the painter
Androcydes.2

Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner: Most of the philo-
sophers have a better claim to be called slanderers
than the comic poets. Take Aeschines the pupi]
of Socrates, in his book Telauges . . . and his Callias
not only has an account of the quarrel between
Callias and his father, but contains gibes at the
sophists Prodicus and Anaxagoras. For he declares
that Prodicus finished the education of Theramenes,
and the other that of Philoxenus son of Eryxis and
Ariphrades brother of Arignotus the singer to the
lyre, intending the reader to infer the nature of this
education from the gluttony and general depravity
of the pupils.
