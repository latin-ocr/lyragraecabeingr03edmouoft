PREFACE

account of the subject would be impossible, will not
be thought out of place. Its position is unusual, but
Ι do not regret it. Like many so-called introductions
it will read, as it was written, the better for being
taken last.

Many new readings will be found in BacchylideS,
Timotheus, and Philoxenus. They have nowhere, Ι
think, been preferred to those of earlier editors
without good reason, generally palaeographical.
Those of Bacchylides come of long study of the
British Museum Papyri, in the chief of which a
large number of the accepted readings were found
inconsistent either with the length of the gap or
with the possible reading of doubtful letters. The
new readings of the Persae, which are mostly due to
the filling of gaps not previously attempted, are
based on the facsimile and confirmed by the autopsy
of Dr. Schubart. With the Banquet there was still
much for ordinary emendation to do; I have
thought it sufficient here to avail myself of the
published accounts of the MSS.

My thanks are due to the Egypt Exploration
Society for permission to include the two Ena-omia of
Bacchylides, to Messrs. H. J. M. Milne and H. I.
Bell of the British Museum and to Dr. Schubart of
the Berlin Museum for their expert help with the
Papyri, to Professor A. S. Hunt for access to new
material and permission to print it, to Mr. A. D.
Knox for several valuable suggestions, particularly
with regard to the metre, on the Banquet of Phi-
loxenus, to Dr. A. B. Cook and Mr. H. Rackham for
giving me the benefit of their criticism of the
Epilogue, to the general editors of the Series for
dealing kindly with a sometimes refractory con-
