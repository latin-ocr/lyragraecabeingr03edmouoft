LIFE OF TIMOTHEUS

Hephaestion On Poems: ‘Frec’ verse is that
which is written as it were at randum and without
any definite metre, like the lyre-sung nomes of
Timotheus.

Aristotle Problems: Why are Nomes not written
antistrophically like the choral songs ? Is it because
they were sung by professional actors who were
naturally able to employ mimetic gesture and to
extend themselves at will, with the result that their
song became long and of varied shape, and the
melody, like the words, went with the action and
varied continually? For the mimetic element is
more indispensable to the air than to the wordS. In
the same way Dithyrambs, having become mimetic,
are no longer, as they once were, antistrophic ; and
the reason is that in the old days they were danced
by the ordinary citizen, and many found mimetic
singing difficult, with the result that they employed
in them the enharmonio style, because frequent
modulation is easier for one than for many, and
easier for the professional actor than for those who
remain in their own character ; and thus the poems
they composed for'them were simple, which is typica]
of the antistrophic system, involving as it does a
recurring unit. It is for the same reason that what
is sung upon the stage is not antistrophic, while the
songs of the chorus are so. For the actor is a
professional artist and a natural mimic, whereas the
chorus does not carry its mimicry so far.

Pollux Onomasticon: The parts of the Lyre-sung
Nome as arranged by Terpander are seven, namely
the beginning, the after-beginning, the turning-
down, the after-turning-down,1 the navel or middle,
the seal, and the epilogue.2
