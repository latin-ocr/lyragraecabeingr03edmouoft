Hippolytus Aqainst the Heresies: For since the man Adam
is the foundation of their argument and they say it is
written of him ⁶ Who shall tell his generation ¹?'‚ learn how

privilege of giving forth our human kind,

wishing to be mother not of senseless plants‚ nor of speechless
buttes, but of a gentle race beloved of God,

Cephissian Lake, or the Idaean Curetes or Phrygian
Corybants were the divine race the Sun first saw bud
