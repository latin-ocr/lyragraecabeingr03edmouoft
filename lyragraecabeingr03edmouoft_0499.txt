To Fon'rcxss on CHANCE
From a Fourth-Century Papyrus ε

Wing—sandalled being of many hands and varied
shape, housemate of man, almighty Fortune, how
should thy strength and excellence be told? That
which shines proudly on high, comes it but within
thy ken, thou rendest privily and scatterest on the
ground in a murky cloud,1 and what is mean and
lowly, that, O great deity, ostentime thou dost
raise alost. whether shall we call thee black Clotho
or ficet-fate Necessity, or art thou Iris, the messenger
'twixt Gods and men? For thou holdest the
beginning and the last end of everything that is.‘·³
