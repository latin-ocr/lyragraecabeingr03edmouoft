EARLY HYMNS: A BOEOTIAN SCHOOL?

do their dancing by proxy3 Hesiod's Apollo, like Archi-
lochus, still leads the dance as he sings and plays. That
the early Hymn proper, that is the more strictly ritual
part 01 1116 Η61010 Lay, was, like the Hymn to the Muses
which begins the ll'orks (md Days and some 01 1116 extant
Homeris: Hymns, quite short, is perhaps indicated by
Pausanias' remark on the shortness of the only genuino
Hymns 01 Orpheus. Before the partition (which would
be aided by the fact 11131 06113111 narratives would be
more acceptable than others to any particular audience

be just 33 welcome to the descendants of one hero as to
those 01 311011161) 1116 1111131 part would tend 10 shrink,
like the choral element in the Attic Drama. Once the
partition was complete, 1116 Hymn 113611 would tend 10
become partly secularised and lengthen out into narrative,
such as we find in the longer H omerio H ymas and Alcaeus’
Hymn to Apollo.

Among the. early bards we hear 01 Α1111163 01
Anthedon in Boeotia, who composed hymns, Pierus
01 Ρ16113 who composed ‘ the poems about the
Muses,’ the Delphian Philammon who described in
lyric poems (or in music) the births 01 Leto and
Artemis and Apollo, and first established choruses
at the Delphian temple. These may not all be
facts, but it 13 31 least clear that Central Greece
kept its light burning throughout the Da-rk Age.
The irmnemorial use 01 1116 Hexameter, though not
invariable, in the Delphic oracles, betokens the high
antiquity 01 1116 staff 01 poets which Strabo tells us
was attached to the temple 101 11113 purpose. With
such literature the didactic element in Hesiod doubt-
less 1133 301116 kinship.l Even in Hesiod's day there
seems to have been something 01 1116 11311116 01
poetry—schools or guilds 01 poets in Boeotia. The
cult 01 1116 Μ11363 there, the existence 01 1116 Homeridae
in Chios, the parallel 01 1116 Asclepiadae in Cos, and
the way in which the Greeks took it for granted, as
101 instance in Plato's Protaqoras, that arts and
crafts passed from father to son, seem to point here
