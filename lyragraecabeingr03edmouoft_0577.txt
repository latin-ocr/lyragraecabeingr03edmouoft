SCOLIA

ATTIC SCOL1A1

Athenaeus Doctors at Diomer: Many of the guests men-
tioned the well-known Attie Scolia or Drinking-Songs.
These too call for notice here because of the ancient and
simple style in which they are written, Alcaeus and
Anacreon being famous for this particular type of poem,
witness Aristophanes in the Banquetcrs: ‘Take and sing
a drinking-song of Alcaeus or Anacreon.' Another cele-
brated writer of scolia was Praxilla of Sicyon. These songs
are so called not because the style of verse in which they
are written is σκολιός or ‘cmokedss for they are said to be
reckoned among the laxet type of verse. But according to
Artemon of Casandreia in the second volume of his Use of
Books, which contains the poems sung at banquets, there
were of these three kinds, of which the first was by custom
sung by all the company together, and the second in a kind
of succession round the table in which no gaps were allowed ;
the third, unlike the other two, was performed only by the
guests who were considered real musicians, regardless of the
order in which they sat, and so was called σκόλιον or
‘crooked song' only as being irregular compared with the
others, that is, as not being sung by all together nor yet in
succession, but by some just as it might happen. Moreover
the scolia were sung after the songs which were general and
compulsory. When those were over each of the really
musical guests was asked to entert-ain the company to a
good song, ‘ good' meaning one which appeared to contain
some exhortation or sentiment of practical utility.

Among the Deipnosophists or Dining Doctors, one now
recited his choice among the scolia, and another his. All
that were given will be found in the following pages.2
