THE DRINKING-SONG

The term Scolion apparently carne to bc. used of the
post-Paeanic song if it was sung while the drinking went
on, the term Encomium if it was sung when it was over—
οι· nearly over. The exact moment when the κῶμος could
be said to have begun was often doubtless as imaginary as
the Equator, and thus the term Encomium was often used
of a song sung at the table. Hence the seeming confusion
in what, even if it was editorially useful‚ was a funda-
mentally arbitrary classification. It is to be noted that
the Argument to Pindar mentions a Book of Encomia but
not of Scolia, though Amenaeus cites his 125th fragment
from the ‘ Scolion to Hiero ’; and that Aristotle classes
as an Encomium the Harmodius-Sonq, which may never-
theless be taken as typical of the Attio Scolia, a collection
which no doubt formed part of the library of every Athenian
lyrist·schoolmaster in the mid-5th Century. We shall
speak of this presently. The earliest Drinking-Songs were
ascribed, perhaps wrongly, to the Lesbian Terpander. In
any case it is clear that they came up as art-forms about
the middle of the 7th Century, and their budding in
Alcman and theirvflowering in Alcaeus suggest an Aeolian,
perhaps once part-Lydiam stock.

Alcaeus uses the Scolion not only as a pure Drinking-
Song, but as a Political Song, to rally nobles against
Commoris, to attack the tyrants; as a war-song, to
inspire his countrymen in the Athenian and Erythraean
wars; and, inevitably in such a man and in such a quarter
of the Greek world, as a Love-song. Aristotle quotes an
attack on Pittacus as from the Drinkiny-Sonqs‚ and yet
Alexandria seems to have put the Scolia in one Book and
the Stasiotica in another. The distinction would prob-
ably have puzzled Alcaeus himself. They were all Songs
of the Table. The invective element came, if you will,
from Archilochus, the erotic from Mimnermus, the warlike
from Tyrtaeus. But in the hands of Alcaeus the invective
becomes public instead of private, the erotic active
instead of passive, and the warlike personal instead of
tribal. This development was due partly to the man,
and partly, as we have seen, to the hour. Sappho’s Table5
Songs were sometimes political, but more often, we may
believe, songs of love and friendship. She, too, however,
was a good hater, and it is clear that she sometimes
attacked her rivals‚ if not to their faces, at least in a
company of sympathisers who would pass the song 011.
Like their imitator Horace, both Lesbians seem, as has
