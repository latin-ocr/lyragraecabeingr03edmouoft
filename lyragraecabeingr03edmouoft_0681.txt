LAUREL BEARING SONG

funeral rites commemorating the death of Aegeus, and a
banquet. The songs were probably of a two-feld nature
alternating grief for the death of the father with joy for
the triumph of the son.

Of the DAPHNEPHORIOA or Laurel-bearing Songs,
which were composed by Alcman, Alcaeus, and
Simonides, and of which Pindar's works contained
three Books, we now have an incomplete example
written by the Theban poet for the Daphnephoria
held every eight years in his native city in honour of
Apollo Ismenius.

The procession, said to be commemorative of an ancient
victory over the Oetaeans, consisted of a chorus of branch-
bearing maidens led by the priest of the year, a handsome
boy of noble birth, called the DaphnephoruS, who,
with his unbound hair crowned with a golden diadem and
wearing a long and richly-embroidered vestment and a
special kind of shoes, followed his nearest kinsman of either
sex, the actual ⁶ bearer‚' with his hand upon the laurel.
This ⁶ laurel ² was an olive-branch bound with bay and
fiowers, which was surmounted by a globe of copper from
which depended a number of smaller globes, and had tied
to its middle another small globe to which were fastened
purple ribbons‚ its lower end being wrapped in a piece of
yellow cloth. The explanation given was that the upper
globe and its dependant-s represented the sun, the planets,
and the stars, the lower the moon, and the ribbons‚ which
were 365 in number, the days of the year. Similar rites
were observed at Athens and elsewhere, notably at Delphi,
whither every eight years a chorus of children, led by a
child Daphnephorus personating Apollo, brought laurel-
branches by a traditional route from Tempe, in com-
memoration, it was said, of Apollo’s return from his journey
thither to purify himself after slaying the Serpent.
Pindar’s extant Daphnephoricon is written in Triads of
fifteen short lines. His Daphnephorus’ father Pagondas,
whose own father Aeoladas is the real inspirer of the poem,
commanded the Thebans when they defeated the Athenians
at Delium long afterwards. The girls of the chorus sing of
the occasion; of themselves and their dress; of the Daphne-
phorus and the honours his family has won in the Games‚
with some reference to Theban politics3 but the myth,
if there was one, is not extant.
