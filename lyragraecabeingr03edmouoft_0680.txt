PRAYER-SONG: GRAPE-BEARING SONG

he did the inscriptional Epitaph, to the highest point of
excellence, equalled, but not sui-passed, by a poet whose
thoughts were deeper but not wider, of whose Dirges we
have several considerable fragments. In one of these
Pindar describes the life of the departed, in the other he
seemingly embodies the Orphic doctrine of reincarnation.
We know, too, that Pindar wrote a Dirge for Hippocrates,
brother of the great Athenian Cleisthenes, who probably
died about 486. The instrument of the Dirge, naturally,
considering its connexion with the Elegy, was the flute.

Apart from the Dithyramb and the Nome, which
are reserved for a later page, we find in the catalogue
of Proclus, which is based on Didymus, four more kinds
of Melie, Partheneia, Da-phnephoriea, Oschophorica,
and PRAYER-Soxes.

The last, εὐκτικά, are probably a late subdivision of the
Hymn, of which we see a trace in one of the Alexandrian
titles of Simonides’ Books, κατευχαί. They apparently
differed from the Hymn in accentuating the element of
petition, but they did not eschew the myth. Simonides’
Sea—Fiyht off Artemisium was, it would seem, a Prayer-
Song performed in obedience to the oracle which bade
Athens ask aid of the son-in-law of Erechtheus, that is
Boreas, and perpetuated, if we may interpret Himerius,
in the Panathenaic procession.

The Athenian OSCHOPHORICON was a form of
Processional song-dance performed just before the
vintage by twenty youths chosen two from each tribe.

These traditionally represented the young Athenians
rescued by Theseus from the Minotaur3 but the rite clearly
was a conflation, for besides Theseus and Ariadne, it did
honour to Dionysus and Athena Sciras, the latter the
protectress of the olive. The two principal dancers‚ who
were dressed as maidens in memory of the ruse by which
Theseus increased the proportion of males to females in
the human tribute of Athens to CnossuS‚ carried grape-
hung vine-branches3 women who represented the mothers
of the intended victims carried in the procession baskets
of food like that with which they had furnished them for
their voyage; and the ceremony, besides the bearing of
the vine-branches (ὔσχοι) from the temple of Dionysus
at Athens to that of Athena Sciras at Phalerum, included
races among the choristerS, and on their return¹ to Athens
