TIMOTHEUS
24 1

Athenaeus Doctors (ιε Dinner: If then I have offendcd,
O thou hunter of fincst nouns and verbs, do not bc angry.
For, to quote the poet Timotheus of Miletus:

I sing not the old songs, for my new songs are
better; a young Zeus reigns and Cronus’ rule was
long ago; away with the ancient Musel2

253

Athenaeus Doctors at Dz‘vmer: The ancient Nestor was the
greatest drinker among the heroes . . . and he alone has had
his cup described by Homer, as Achilles has had his shield.
He took it to the war with him as he did the shield ‘whose
fame, ² according to Hector,4 ‘ reached even to the sky.’
Indeed we might apply (literally) to his cup the phrase
quoted by Antiphanes ln the Caeneus, where he says: ‘Then
give me, pray, what Timotheus calls

the goblet of Aies5

and a polished javelin.’

26

The Same [on riddles]: Compare Anaxandrides' Aeschra:
‘He has but now cut up (the ox), and the end-to-end
portions of the carcase

he subdueth in the fire-built covert,

as Timotheus says, my boys, when he means, I suppose, the
pot.

short, as for instance in Timotheus thus:
