Aelian On Animals: That dolphins have a natural liking
for singing and the ssute, witness Arion of Methymna hy
token of the statue 2 at Cape Taenarum and the inscription
thereon, which runs ‘By iminortal guidance this equipagc
saved Arion son of Cycleus from the Siciliam main.’ The
hymn of thanksgiving to Poseidon which testifies to the
dolphins’ love of music was composed by Arion ³ as a mecd of
gratitude not only to him but to them. It. is as follows:

Chiefest of Gods, sea-lord Poseidon of the trident
of gold, earth-shaking king of the swelling4 brine,
the beasts that swim dance all about thee with fins,
and lightly bound with nimble flingings of the foot,
the snub-nosed coursing hounds of bristling mane,
the dolphin-lovers of the Muse, sea-creatures of
Nereus’ goddess-daughters that he had of Amphi-
trite, the beasts that bore a wanderer on the Sicilian
sea to Taenarum's shore in Pelops’ land, ploughing
the untrodden furrow of Nereus' field astride their
humped back, when crafty men had cast me from
out the hollow wave-going ship into the sea-purple
billows of the ocean.

Thus, in addition to the characteristics mentioned above,
it is clear that dolphins are fond of music.
