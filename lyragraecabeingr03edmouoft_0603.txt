THE NATURE OF GREEK METRE

than the dirge for an actual burial. If it be true
that children’s games are often rituals that have
degenerated, it is significant that we find mention of
μολπή, song-dance, when Nausicaa plays ball with her
maidens (Od. 6. 100). When Alcinous gives a dis-
play by the two champion ball-throwers‚ it is a dance ε

‘ and the other youths stood by the lists and beat
time (or shouted in time), and a great din uprose.’ 1

In connexion with this early song and dance we
have had more than one mention of beating time to,
or keeping in time with, the performer. This brings
us to the question os THE NATURE oF GREEK METRE.

It is usual nowadays to maintain that it went entirely
by length of syllable3 there was no ⁶ ictus.' This, it is
true, tallies with what we know of the natural accentua-
tion—-pitch, not stress—of the language in classical times;
and if the history of early Greek music could be confined
to the flute, the theory would, on the face of it, be reason-
able enough. But all the early bards are lyre-players‚
and for a good reason; the lyre-player, unlike the fiute-
player, can sing to his own accompaniment. Moreover
‘ percussivo ' sound like that of the lyre was probably
found a better accompaniment to the dance than the
‘ sustained’ sound of the flute.2 There is no instance
in Homer of dance or song accompanied merely by a
flute. Now it is well known that languages change the
nature of their accentuation‚ at one period stress (or
varied loudness) predominates, at another pitch (or varied
note); and Latin, a stress-language, successfully adopted
Greek metre. It seems therefore more likely that the
Greek metre of classical times did involve a very appreci-
able ictus; and this (though of course it came to run
counter to the natural pitch-aecent of the word, and, as
in Polish folk-music and in English blank verse, could
be shifted on occasion from its ‘ proper ’ place)³ may
well have been a survival from the time when Greek or

and staccato-playing when leading ⁴ congregational ' singfflg, like
that of the Greek fiuteplayer to the κρούπεζα or foot-elapper
when training a chorus, shows that they feel the metrical short-
comings of their instrument ³ as perhaps in the substitution
of ψ- for -ψ (Anaelasis); aq. in Sappho 86 cf. 11. ’7 and 16
