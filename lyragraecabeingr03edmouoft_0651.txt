IBYCUS

which is a nickname, indeed proves that he made some
great advance in Choral Melie, and Suidas‘ authority
declares that all his poetry was ‘ epodic.’ Yet the very
length of some of his poems points to Monody, and it
seems well-nigh impossible, particularly in view of the
new fragments oi Ibycus, to regard the arrangement of
Alcman’s Partheneion as anything but triadic. The
problem of priority of invention often remains unsolved
to-day‚ with all the relevant documents available. In
this case the internal evidence is almost none, and the
external slight and indirect or else oi questionable
authority.

But there is no doubt that this Dorian who inspired
Euripides the tragic poet and Polygnotus the painter‚
who was parodied by Aristophanes and sung at
Athenian banquets, ancl whose chora-l achievements
became the proverbial test of a Greek’s claim to have
been educated, was a very great man.

The next great name comes a generation later.
IBYCUS is for many reasons an interesting figure.
This Dorian poet, who in so many ways resembles
Stesichorus, and whose works were sometimes con·
fused with his, refused to become tyrant of his
native city, the half-Dorio, half-Ionio Rhegium, and
not only withdrew to the Ionian court of Aiaces at
Samos but, as we now know, dedicated his poems
(or a Book of his poems) to his son and successor
Polycrates. This shows very clearly the power to
which a poet could still attain by virtue of what
we may call the medicine-man tradition. It was
used either to thwart the power of the commercial
tyrant, or, as Alcaeus used it, to rally the aristocrats
against the rising middle-class, And it is charac-
teristic of the age that the same man who was offered
the supreme power in his birthplace, is the first
recorded instance, after the Heroic Age, of a court-
poet.

Ibycus’ metres bear a close resemblance to those of
Stesichorus. They are mainly combinations of Dactyl
and Trochee with the Dactyl predominating. The struc-

ture οἱ his poems‚ some of which we now know to have
been triafflc, shows no advance on Alcman. But we see
