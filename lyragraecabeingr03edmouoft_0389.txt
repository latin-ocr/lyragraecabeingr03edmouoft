LIFE OF PHILOXENUS OF CYTHERA

asked. It seems that after his escape from the
Syracusan stone—quarry to which 116 had been con-
signed for failing to praise the tragedies of the
tyrant Dionysius, Philoxenus of Cythera was sent
for by his late patron from Tarentum where he now
lived. He determined not to reply by ordinary
letter, but took a roll of paper aud merely inscribed
in it a succession of O’s, thus indicating that he
refused to return.1

Scholiast on Aristidesz2 (1) After his ssight
Dionysius wrote to Philoxenus urging him to re-
turn and promising that he would find him a
generous host. But he replied by a letter which
contained nothing but a row of O's, by which he
meant, ‘You are nothing to me, I don't care,
I won’t come to such as you. Go weep, go
wail, go hang!'3—(2) Philoxenus of Cythera, after
making his escape from the stone-quarry to which
the despot Dionysius had committed him for re-
fusing to praise his tragedies, was living at Crotona
in Italy, when Dionysius heard of it and requested
him to return to Syracuse. WVhereupon he took
paper and wrote in the middle of the page 3 small
O, and a larger one round it, and a still larger one
round that—like this,4 and when he had filled the
paper with concentric O's sent the paper off to
Dionysius as an emphatic and repeated ‘No.'
Hence the proverb ‘The O of Philoxenus' of
emphatic denials. It is such a denial that Aristides
