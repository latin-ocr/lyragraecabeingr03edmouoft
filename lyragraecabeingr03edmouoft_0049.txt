CORINNA

good son Hermes. For them did Love and Cypris
persuade to go secretly to thy house and take thy
daughters nine.1 And they in good time shall bear
thee a race of demigod heroes, and be fruitful
mothers of children. Learn thou both the things
thou didst ask of the oracular tripod, and how it
is I learnt them. This honour have Ι of fifty mighty
kinsmen, the s‘hare allotted Acraephen² in the 1101)γ
sanctuary as forthteller of the truth.

For the son of Leto gave the right of speaking
oracles from his tripods first unto Euonymus3 and
Hyrieus3 it was who cast him out of the land and
held the honour second after him, Hyrieus son of
Poseidon 3 and my sire Orion took his land to him-
self and had it next, and now dwells in heaven—
that is his portion of honour. Hence comes it that
I know and tell the truth oracular. And as for
thee, my friend, yield thou to the Immortals and set
thy mind free from tumult, wife’s father to the Gods.
