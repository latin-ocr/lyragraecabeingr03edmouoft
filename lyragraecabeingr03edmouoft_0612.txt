from the competition because he had not learnt to accom-
pany himself on the lyre. Homer came to Delphi to
inquire of the oracle ; but even if 116 had known how to
play the lyre, the loss of his sight would have made the
accomplishment useless.’

Apparently the informants of Pausanias believed that
Homer and Hesiod were not musicians as well as
poets, that is that they were rhapsodes or reciters
of Epic verse. Did the rise of true Epic as opposed

to the Heroic Lay begin the divorce of Greek poetry

Thrace. As we have seen, he first established choruses
to the God3 according to some accounts he invented the
Lyric Nome. Thamyris is mentioned as contemporary
with Eurytus, that is with Heracles, in the Cataloque,
Il. 2. 591. Strabo, strangely enough, makes him ruler
of part of the Chalcidic peninsula. Heracleides ascribes
to him a Battle of the Titane. To the same Thracian
family belonged, according to some authorities, Eumolpus
and Musaeus. The reputed descendants of Eumolpus
were priests of the Eleusinian MysterieS. The story
which made him a grandson of Boreas through the Attic
maiden Oreithyia probably reflects a desire to associate
him with Athens rather than Eleusis. Musaeus was said
to have invented the Dactyl.l Besides a collection of
oracles (see vol. ii, p. 223), he was credited with the
authorship of works which remind us of Hesiod, Preceptse,
Ὑποθῆκαι, addressed to his son, and a Theoqony. But Pau-
sanias believed (1. 22) that his only genuine extant work
was ‘ the Hymn he composed to Demeter for the Lyco·
mids.' Athenian tradition gave him burial on t-he Museum
Hill. Three words of'his‚ quoted by Aristotle, stand as
