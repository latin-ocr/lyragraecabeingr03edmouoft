FOLK-SONGS z INTRODUCTION

seast, nothing but georgics, nothing but what was
rustical was there. Here one sang like the reapers,
there another prattled it and flung flirts and scoffs
as in the autumn from the preSS. Philetas played
upon his pipes, Lampis upon the hautboy. Dryas
and Lamo danced to thern.1

The Same:1 Then‚ when it was night, they all
lead the bride and bridegroom to the chamber, some
playing upon whistles and hautboys, some upon the
oblique pipes‚ some holding great torches. And
when they came near to the door they fell to singing,
and sang with the grating harsh voices of rustics‚
nothing like the Hymenaeus, but as if they had been
singing at their labour with mattock and hoe.‘·³

Scholiast on Theocritus lee Reapers [‘Come, hear
this of the divine Lityerses']: By this he means
‘ Hear this tragedy [sic] of mine, which Ι am about
to sing concerning Lityerses'; now this Lstyerses,
who lived at Celaenae in Phrygia, used to compel
passing strangers after feasting at his table to reap
with him, and when evening carne would cut off
their heads, and binding the trunk into a sheaf
with the trusses of corn, would sing a song; but he
was eventually slain by Heracles and thrown into
the river Maeander. Which is why in Phrygia to
this day the reapers sing his praise as a champion
reaper.3

Aristophanes Clouds: But he said at once that it
was old-fashioned to sing and play after supper like
a wench grinding barleycorns.
