ALCMAN

range from three lines to six—not fourteen, for the ancient
belief that the Triad (strophe, antistrophe and epode) was
the invention of Stesichorus is probably not quite correct.
The threefold choric arrangement has its early Spartan
analogue in the Sony of the Three Aqes, and a short strophe
of four lines followed by an only slightly longer epode of
six, is more likely at this early period than a strophe of so
many lines as fourteen. But it should be noted that,
as in Anacreon and to a great extent too in Sappho and
Alcaeus, each strophe consists of a repetition of homor-
rhythmic units3 it is probable also that, as with them,
the same metrical system occurred in more than one of
Alcman's poems. It is interesting to note that the sense
always ends with his triad, but not necessarily with his
strophe.

Alcman’s place as the first of the Nine Lyric Poets
was doubtless primarily due to the preservation of his
poems into Alexandrian times, and their preservation
proves their popularity. The epitaph seen by
Pausanias said with pride that his poems ‘were not
made the less sweet because he used the tongue of
Sparta '—-whjch seems to indicate that his dialect
was an innovation.

His predecessors, mostly Lesbian, had perhaps run the
Aeolio tendencies too strong, and the patriotic objectors
(prototypes of the upholders of British music during the
late war) welcomed a poet who would put a reasonable
amount os Doric into these songs of Dorians. The epitaph
is probably not contemporary3 but it may have been put
up at some time, perhaps during the Peloponnesian War,
when Spartan pride in everything Spartan was at its
height. The same pride would secure the repeated per-
formance and consequent preservation of his poems, as
made him a Spartan instead of a Lydian.

His dialectic innovation, though not so remarkable
as would appear at first sightst was doubtless a real
advance, but his claim to greatness rested, as we have
seen, on greater things.

1 the late Laconian forms such as σ for θ must be due to
comparatively late editing3 inscriptions show that these
changes were not recognised in the spelling of the dialect till
some generations after the time of Alcman
