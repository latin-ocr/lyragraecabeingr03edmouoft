TI MOTHEUS

Athenaeus Doctors at Dinncr: And Odysseus (Od. 10. 208)
gave ‘red honey-sweet wine from one full cup, and poured
thereon twenty measures of water3 and the sweet scent

{ost} from the mixing·bowl.' Compare too Timotheus in the
με ops:

First poured he one ivy-wood cupful of the dark
immortal dewdrops teeming with foam, then poured
therein twenty measures, mingling· the blood of
Bacchus with the freshet tears of the Nyinphs.

Plutarch Life of Philopoemen: The story is told that during
Philopoemen’s second command, shortly after the victory of
Mantinea, when there was a pause in his military operat-ions
because of the Nemean Games,⁴ he first made a publio display
oiim-⁶¹³ phalanx both drawn up in order of battle and going
§insugh its usual evolutions with vigour and despatch, and
then visited the theatre during the lym-song competition,
accompanied by his young warriors in their military cloaks
and crimson tunics, men all of an age and in the prime of
their strength, who showed a high respect for their leader as
well as the youthful pride which came of a long tale of
victorious combats. At the very moment of their entrance,
the lyre-singer Pylades, who was performing the Persian& of
Timotheus, began it with these words:

¹ cf. Eust. 1631. 61 ² i.e. ‘don’t think you (Odysseus)

can do the impossible, that is, escape me’ ³ cf. Paus.
8. 50. 3, where ⁴ a Pythian victor' Pylades performs a Nome
of Timotheus of Miletus called The Persians ⁴ 207 Β. C.
