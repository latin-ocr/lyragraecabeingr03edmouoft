FoR CLEOPTOLEMUS OF THESSALY

V1cTon IN THE CuAmoT-RACF, AT THE Parmml

A happy destiny is God's best gift to man3 but
even as Chance crusheth the good if she come with
a load of woe, so she maketh the wicked eminent if
she win her way. Honour hath various shapes, and
myriad are the kinds of human prowess3 yet one
outstandeth all, and it is his whom a just mind
guides in what lieth to his hand. The deep misery
of battle is no place for the voice of the lyre and the
clear-ringing dance, nor hath the clash of bronze
with bronze to do with merrymaking; rather in
every act of man is the right time the best, and
God too prospereth him that doeth a thing well.
And now ’tis the time to sing a meed unto Cleopto-
lemus, to sing together of the precinct of Poseidon
of the Rock and of Pyrrichus’2 glorious chariot-victor
son, who [went forth from] a hospitable and upright-
