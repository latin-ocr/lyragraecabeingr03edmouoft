SIMONIDES

Like Lasus, he seems to have thrown himself into the
musico-poetical side of. the popular movement, and
is recorded as having won a victory as poet and
chorus-trainer in the year after the battle of Mara-
thon. At the age of eighty he won his fifty—sixth
prize for the Dithyramb. He wrote the inscription
for the new statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton
set up in 477. Friend of the foremost Athenian
Themistocles and of the foremost Spartan Pausanias,
he now wrote Epitaphs, Dirges, and other poems of
the war, some of them in competition with other
poets such as Aeschylus, some, we may believe, by
direct commission. The last few years of his long
life were spent at the court of Hiero of Syracuse, the
resort at that time of his nephew Bacchylides, of
Pindar, and of Aeschylus. In the year 475 his
influence with Hiero, his fame in Sicily, and the
traditional respect paid to poets as healers of discord,
were such that he made peace in the field between

the armies of Hiero and Theron of Acragas before a
blow had been struck.

Besides his fame as a poet, Simonides enjoyed in anti-
quity the reputation of having invented the art of mne·
monics, some system, presumably, of memory-training3
and also of having added certain letters to the alphabet,
a tradition founded perhaps on his having set the fashion
at Athens, as a popular Ionian poet well might do, of
employing the Ionic alphabet, which seems to have come
into vogue in Attic literature in the middle of the 5th
Century, though it did not supersede the old alphabet
officially till the first year after the Peloponnesian War.

For us Simonides lives in his noble Epitaphs of
the Persian W ar, in his great little Dirge for the
heroes of Thermopylae, and in his incomparable
Danae. These rank with the fragments of Sappho,

the Parthenon, and the Dialogues of Plato as the
finest living flowers of the Greek genius.

Hymns, Paeans, Prayers, Dithyrambs—these to the
Gods3 Dirges, Epinicia, Eulogies, Inscriptions—these to
men; such was the ancient classification of his works.
