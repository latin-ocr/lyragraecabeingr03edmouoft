CHRYSOTHEMIS: PHILAMMON: THAMYRIS

composed various Hymns for the Delians including one
to Eileithyia, in which he calls her

or ‘ dest spinner.’ Tho Hymn doubtless celebrated the
births of Apollo and Artemis, Olcn's hymns are prob-
ably referred to in the Homeric lemn to elec Deliam
Apollo <156): ‘And there is this great wonder also,
whose renown shall never die, the Delian maids that are
servants of the F ar Shoot er; for when they have praised
Apollo and after him Leto and Artemis that delighteth
in arrows, they sing a stiain telling of men and women
of ancient days and charm the tribes of men.’ These
Hymns, known to Herodotus, were still performed 111
the days of Callimachus (see p. 488, above). Of the several
recorded inventors of the Hexameter, the claim of Olen
is perhaps the best established.

All these survivals of the Dark Age seem to be
connected with Apollo or Demeter. §peaking of the
earliest competition at Delphi, Pausanias says (7. 2)
that he was told that the subject of the contest was
a Hymn to the God, and that the winner was Chryso-
themis of Crete, son of Carmanor priest of Apollo.
The Cretan connexion, confirmed by archaeological
finds, occurs too in the H ymn to the Pythian Apollo,
which makes the God appoint as his ministers at
Delphi the crew of a Cretan shjp of Cnossus, miracul—
ously guided to the port of Crisa.

‘ The next winner ’ continues Pausanias ‘ was Philam-
mon, and next to him Philammon’s son Thamyris.
Orpheus, however, gave himself such airs because of the
Mysteries that he would not enter for the prize, and
Musaeus, who laid himself out to copy Orpheus, followed
his example.’ This seems to mean that Orpheus and
Musaeus, as belonging to the Eleusinian Mysteries of
Demeter, could not reasonably be supposed to have
competed in a Hymn to Apollo. The tradition points
to an ancient jealousy between Eleusis and Delphi.
‘ They say ’ he goes on ‘ that Eleuther won a Pythian
victory by his strong sweet voice alone, for the song he
sang was not his own.’ We may note this early, and to
Pausanias noteworthy, case of a lyrist-musieian who was
not also a poet. ‘ It is said too that Hesiod was excluded
