Plutarch lee G‘ood-Fortune or V {fr-cue of Alexander:
Archelaus appearing sornewhat stingy in the matter of his
gffts, Timotheus hinted at it several times by using the
following phrase in a song

but as for thee, thou praisest earth-born silvei-3

and at last Archelaus not inelegantly called out at him,
‘But- as for you, you beg it.'

Plutarch Dzssnner-table Problems: [on sleeping in the moon-
light]: It is also said to be a specific for promoting easy
labour when the moon is full, reducing the pains by a re-
mission of the moisture. Hence, I take it, Artemis is called
Bringer-to-bed and the Midwife, being identical with the
Moon. Timotheus is quite clear on the point:

through the blue vault of the stars and of the
swift-delivering Moon

Porphyrius quoted by Stobaeus Selections [on the soul]:
Implying further that after death the souls of the pious
have their proper place around the moon, Homer uses the
following words :4 ‘But the Immortals will send thee to
the Elysian Plain and the ends of the earth, where lives the
golden-haired Rhadamanthus‚' naturally giving the name of
Elysian Plain to the surface of the moon illuminated by the
sun when, in Timotheus’ phrase,

she groweth with the sun's rays.
