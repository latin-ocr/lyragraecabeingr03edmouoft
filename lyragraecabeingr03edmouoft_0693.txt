THE BEGINNING OF THE END

describes; while its rhythms are easy and tranquil, it-
employs compound expressions. Each of course has its
particular “modes,” the Dithyramb the Phrygian and
Hypophrygian, the Nome the Lydian system of the
singers to the lyre.' Here Proclus' authority clearly was
speaking, if not of the Dithyramb before Melanippides
and of the Nome before Phrynis‚ at any rate of both before
the worst results of their innovations had worked them-

selves out.

In the Clouds (423 B.c.) Aristophanes bewails the
change of taste which had made such songs as those
of Lamprocles out of date; in the first Book of the
Republic (c. 385) Plato makes the aged Cephalus
quote Pindar as an old man in a modern novel might
cite Tennyson; in his comedy Linus, Alexis (372—

Choerilus, Homer, Epicharmus, prose

It is clear that by the end of the 4th Century, when
playwrights were already writing plays merely to be
read, much even of the verse which had long been
only recited had lost its attraction, and song-poetry,
at any rate the older song, was going out of fashion.
Theophrastus' Late-Learner (319 B.c.)‚ instead of
learning the ‘classicS,’ is at pains to get by heart the
songs he hears at the juggler's show. In a fragment
of Aristotle quoted by Athenaeus (i. 6 d) we read:
‘ They spend the whole day holding forth to chance
audiences at the puppet·shows or to travellers just
arrived from Phasis or the Borysthenes, though they
have never read anyt-hing but Philoxenus' Banquet‚
and indeed have never finished that.’ Here we may
well have a glimpse of the half-literary public who
thumbed the earlier Greek story-books of which we
have somewhat late examples in the fragment of the
