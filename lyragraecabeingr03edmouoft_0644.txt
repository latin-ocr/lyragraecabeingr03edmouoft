‘ NEW '-LESBIAN FORMS

If this is right, the absence of resolved feet from Lesbian
verse seems natural enough. The unit was traditionally
the syllable, not the short syllable, and consequently it
would not occur to anyone to substitute two shorts for
one long. That would come in later as the stress-tradition
faded away and the increasing use of the flate, with its
‘ sustained ’ rather than ‘ percussive ' sound, supported
that growing reliance on variation of length rather than
of loudness which was natural to the art-rhythms of a
pitch-language.1 Last, but not least, Lesbian poetry
speaks its own language. Tyrtaeus mixes, though indeed
rarely, with the traditional Ionio of the Elegy the Dorio
of his audience3 Alcman allows the Aeolio which we may
take it was traditional in the Sparto-Lesbian Succession
to colour the Doric which he was praised for substituting
for it3 Sappho and Alcaeus throw off the foreign yoke
and write as they spoke.2

Here then we have clear evidence of the incorpora-
tion into Greek poetry of a fresh tradition, which
eventually combined with those of Thaletas and
Polymnastus and produced the great lyrics of Pindar
and Aeschylus. Some of its elements may well be
due to Lydian infiuence, old and new. Terpander
introduced the pectis from Lydia3 Sappho was the
first to use the Mixolydian ‘ mode? Others were
native, we may suppose, to Lesbos. The avoidance
of three concurrent short syllables is, as we have
seen, essentially Greek.3 In any case it was doubtless
derived, most of it, from the ‘ folk,’ among whom,
always open indeed to foreign influence, an influence
which in the days of slavery was felt in every house-
hold but the very humblestst it had nevertheless

1 the flute and the tribrach were supposed to be Phrygian
2 this of course does not mean that they eschewed all poetic
locutions; they wrote in the spoken dialect, but what they
wrote was poetry 3 or pre—Greek; Vedio ‘ tends to eliminate
even groups of two shorts ’ (Meillet, Oriq. Indoeurop. des ΙὶΙὲἰνεε
Grecs, p. 45) 4 Plutarch's story of the Helot prisoners of the
Thebans (see p. 611), and the story of the ill-treatment of the
free-born female captive from Olynthus in Demosthenes RL. 402,
imply that it was the custom to make your prisoners-of-war sing
to you ; cf. the Athenian prisoners at Syracuse3 slaves were often
prisoners-of-war ·
