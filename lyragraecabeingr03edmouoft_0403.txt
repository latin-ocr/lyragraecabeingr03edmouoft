THE DITHYRAMBS OF PHILOXENUS
21

Athenaeus Dorum-s αι Dz'nner: Now that our conversation
has reached this point,

A song will I contribute to my love of you,

in the words of the poet of Cythera,

3,42

Aristophanes Plutus: CARION: Yes, I'll lead you with
the Cyclops' ting-a-ling and a criss-cross swing of the legs
like this. Come up, my little oneS, come, with cries multi-
tudiuous‚ chanting the bleats of sheep and malodorous goats,
all rampant aud gay, and you shall break your fast like
hegoats.

Scholiast on the passage : (l) ‘The Cyclops' ting-a-lingz . . .'
this comes from the Cyclops of Philoxenus, who makes the
Cyclops play the lyre . . . He is parodying Philoxenus the
tragedy·writer, who introduced Polyphemus playing the lyre.
The word

ting-a-ling

is a sort of musical phrase aud is instrumental rather than
vocal. The words

Come up, my little ones, come, with eries multi-
tudinous

are from the Cyclops of Philoxenus. Philoxenus is parodied,
the dithyramb-writer who wrote about the love of the
Cyclops for Galatea; and he imitates the sound of the
lyre in his book with the word θρεττανελό or ting-a-ling.
For he introduces the Cyclops playing the lyre in order to
win Galatea’s affection—(2) Philoxenus the dithyramb-
writer was with Dionysius in Sicily. It is said that he once
seduced a woman called Galatea who was Dionysius' mistreSS,
and when he learnt of it Dionysius consigned him to the
stone-quarry. Escaping thence he retired to the highlands
of Cythera and there composed a drama called Galatea, in
which he made the Cyclops Galatea's lover, thus hinting at
Dionysius, whom he likened to the Cyclops, because Dionysius’
sight, like his, was not of the best.
