THE PAEAN

formed two Books of Pindar’s works and at least one of
Bacchylides’. Pindar‘s longest extant fragment opens
with an address to Delos. A song sung in the Prosodiac
metre in honour of the Spartan general Lysander has
the Paeanic refrain and is called a paean by Duris (p. 470).

The PAEAN was apparently a development of a
probably non-Hellenic cry, ἰηπαιάων, used to invoke
3 healing and averting deity who came, after Homer’s
day, to be identified in various parts of Greece with
various Gods and Heroes3 chiefly with Apollo,
though even Pindar’s Book of Paeans contained,
we are told, songs addressed to all the Gods.

The Paean was sung at the beginning of any important
undertaking, such as a voyage, for instance the Athenian
Expedition to Sicily, or a battle—this was post-Homeric—
for instance that of Salamis; 1 in the worship of Apollo as a
special type of song or song-dance of prayer or thanks·
giving, sometimes processional or performed at various
points where a procession temporarily stopped, always
‚ after the libations which followed a sacrifice, taking in
some cases the place of the Hymn3 among the customs
of the feast—originally identical with the sacrifice—as a
particular sort of hymn or prayer after the threefold
libation which bore the same relation to the ensuing
drinking-bont as the sacrifice to the just-completed feast;
after victory, for instance that of Salamis, when Sophocles
played the lyre and led the dance of naked youths, as a
song of thanksgiving and triumph at the setting up of
the trophy or as the returning troops marched 111. With
the last use went, naturally enough as time went 011, the
notion of praise of the victorious general, for instance the
Anapaestic‚ or Prosodiac, and therefore probably Pro-
cessional, Paean sung to Lysander at Samos, and the
competitive Paean performed to Antigonus and Demetrius
at Athens. Side by side with these more formal uses
was the use of the refrain as a mere shout of joy, as it
were H urredi, especially for victory in battle. Eventually
there seems to have arisen some confusion between the
Paean and the Prosodion, and even the Hymn. In
Aristophanes' Thesmophoriazasae (311) the refrain of the
Paean is used as a sort of Amen to the Hymn-prayer. The
