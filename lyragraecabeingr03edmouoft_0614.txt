END OF THE DARK AGE

it must have come in very early. The tradition followed
by Telestes was that it came with Pelops. In any
case we must not imagine, either of wind or string,
that no sort of instrument of the kind was indigenous in
Greece. It has been thought that what Olympus really
introduced was the double-flute. The Egyptians first
used the double-flute after their conquest of Asia Minor.
It was used in Crete in Late Minoan times.

It should be added that the apparent contradictions
in the accounts of cultural importations-Olen of Lycia
and Olen of Thrace, the Hyperborean and Lycian origins
of the worship of Apollo, and the like—are probably due
partly to migrations such as that of the Phrygians across
the Hellespont, partly to rivalries like that between
Delphi and Delos, partly to the desire of the early Greek
colonists of Asia to connect themselves with the Greece
of the Heroic Age. Moreover the traditions of these
early poets are doubtless contaminated by the ulterior
motives of the Orphics and the Pythagoreans. On the
whole we must conclude at present in favour generally
of Eastern and South-Eastern origins rather than Northern.
But the worship of the Muses clearly came from the
North, and there seems to be reason sufficient to make
a further exception of Orpheus.

Between these bards and the age of Homer and
Hesiod, with which we have already dealt, there is
an almost complete blank. Yet we may well believe
there was no break in tradition. Homer, however
we interpret the name, clearly had forerunners. The
passages where the Iliad speaks of two names for
the same person or thing (ay. Il. i. 403), one the
divine and the other the human, point certainly to
an older, probably to a more hieratio and possibly a
non-Hellenic‚ stage of the Epic; and the use of
‘stock’ epithets not justified by the context is a
certain sign of a long tradition. Hesiod, as we have
seen, may have attended a long-established Boeotian
school of poetry; the musico-poetica] contests at
Delphi were of great antiquity; and Orpheus’
severed head, in the myth, was carried by the Hebrus
to the shore of Lesbos. Δ
