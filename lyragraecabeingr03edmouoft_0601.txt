SONG-DANCE IN HOMER

than the song that makes the metaphor applicable. In
the Odyssey (8. 266), Demodocus' song 01 the Loce of Are-3
and Aphrodite is accompanied or at any rate preluded
by a dance 01 young men.

And song was originally cult-song. Traces 01, this,
too, survive in Homer. Phemius calls himself a
minstrel who sings both to Gods and men, that is
both Hymns and Lays, κλέα ἀνδρῶν. Homer often
calls the minstrels θεῖοι, ‘divine’ Their function
appears to have been twofold. They were profes-
3101161 story-singers, and they led the dance. Just
as the banquet was in origin part 01 1116 sacrifice,
so what may be called the ⁶ entertainment ’ side 01
1116 minstrel's activity was once part 01 1116 religious
side. Similarly the cult song-clance at a weddjng
or a funeral cannot be dissociated historically from
the dance or·song-dance which in Homer appears
generally 10 have become a mere entertainment.
The dance depicted on the Shield of Achilles 13 111113

described (Il. 18. 590) :

‘ Also did the glorious Lame God devise therein 6
dancing-place (χορός) like that which Daedalus made
101· 1116 fair-tressed Ariadne in wide Cnosus. There
youths did dance and maidens 01 costly wooing, their
hands upon one another's wrists. Of fine 1111611 was the
maidens' raiment‚ and the youths wore well-woven doublets
glistening with the 011. Fair wreaths had the maids‚ and
the young men daggers 01 gold that hung from silver
belts. And now ran they around with dest feet
exceeding lightly, as when a potter, sitting at the wheel
which fits between his hands, makes trial to see 11 it
run3 now again ran they in lines to meet each other.
Around the lovely dancing-place stood a great crowd
ἒῗέοῗὲἒὲῐγῖἓῗ ἶῖἕῃῗθξὲίέᾞ ῗὴῗνμῗίπΐῗὲῗῂἔξέ ’ἲὲῗὲεέῃΐὲἒὲ
tumblers whirled.’

These tumblers seem to be 6 sort of professional

dancers who lead the rest. As in the Hyporcheme
01 later times, their dancing was probably more
