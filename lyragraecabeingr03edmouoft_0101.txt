LIFE OF BACCHYLIDES

The Same [‘longing for more than they can get,1
they do wound their own selves instead of obtaining
their heart’s desire ’:] The reference again is to
Bacchylides. This is taken to be the meaning owing
to Bacchylides' poems being preferred by Hiero.

[Longinus] On tlze sublime: Again, take lyric
verse; would you sooner be Bacchylides than
Pindar? or take tragedy3 would you sooner be
Ion of Chios than the great Sophocles? Bacchy-
lides and Ion may be faultless, may have attained
to complete mastery of the polished style, whereas
there are times when Pindar and Sophocles carry
all before them like a conflagration, though they
often flicker down quite unaccountably and come
to an unhappy fall. Yet surely no man in his
senses would rate all the plays of Ion put together
at so high a figure as the Oedipus.

Ammonius I‘Vords alike but cister-ent: The Nereids
are not the same as the Daughters of Nereus,
Compare Didymus in his Comme-nimy on the l'ictory-
Songs os Bacchylides, where he says in an explana-
tion: ‘Some authorities declare that the Nereids
are not the same as the Daughters of Nereus, the
latter being his true daughters by Doris and the
former receiving the more general name of Nereids
because they came of other mothers.' 2

Porphyrio on an Ode of Horace [Pastor cum
traheret]: In this ode he imitates Bacchylides, who
makes Cassandra foretell the future events of the
Trojan War as Horace here makes NereuS.³

that in 12 he read Dauyhters os Nereus at l. 102 and Nereids
at l. 38, though the latter is probably not what Bacchylides
wrote and 1⁶2 is a dithyramb ³ cf. 16 below 8
