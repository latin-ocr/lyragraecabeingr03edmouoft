LICYMNIUS
Lm:

Aristotle Rhetoric: But the poets whose works
are in everybody's hands are those who write (not
to be performed but) to be read, such as Chaeremon,
whose style is as finished as that of a professional

speech-writer, and among the dithyrambic poets,
Licymnius.

’ Τ116 Same z The beauty or ugliness of a word
consists in the first place, according to Licymnius, in
the sounds of which it is composed or the meaning
which it conveys.

The Same: Now a term should be applied only
in speaking of a class and a real distinction: other-
wise it is empty and mere nonsense, like the term
used by Licymnius in his Art, where he speaks of
‘ speeding-on ’ and ‘ aberration ' and ‘ raniifications.'

Scholiast on the passage: (a) Licymnius, who
was one of the dithyramb-writers, was an accurate
writer of prose31 (b) Licymnius was an orator; it
was to repetition that he gave the name of
‘ speeding-on.’

Plato Phaedrus [on rhetoric] : And what of Polus
and his so-called shrines of learned speech 2—-
diplasiology (or word-repetition), gnomology (or the
making of sententious remarks), iconology (or the
use of metaphors), and all the other —ologies passing
under the name of Licymnius and presented by him
to Polus by way of improving his style?
