Tm: third and last volume, which brings this
collection down to the end of the Athenian Age,

Fragments till a reprint of the earlier volumes is
called for—and I understand that this will not be
very long—1 shall be able to print them nearer to
their proper places, and meanwhile most of my new
‘ restorations ' will be found in the Proceedz‘ngs of the
Cambridge Plzz'lological Society next spring.

The Account of Greek Lyric Poetry has worked
out longer than I expected, but having written it I

catalogue, which would have been unnecessary, and
a good deal less than a history, which would have
gone beyond the scope of this Series. I hope its
discussion of origins, without which any adequate
