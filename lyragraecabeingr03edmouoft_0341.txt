TIMOTHEUS

that teemeth with blossoms of youth, dings me and
drives me with the flare of censure, for that I dis-
honour the ancient music with poenis young. Yet
do Ι keep no man, be he young or old or my own
compeer, from these my songs3 'tis the debauchers
of the olden music, them keep I off, the tune-
torturers who shriek as long, and shrill as loud, as
any common crier. In the beginning did Orpheus
son of Calliope beget the motley-musicked shell
on Mount Pieria3 and after him came the great
Terpander, born of Aeolian Lesbos at Antissa, and
yoked the Muse unto poems ten;l and lo! now
Timotheus openeth the Muses’ rich and cloistered
treasure-house of song, and gives the lyre' new life
with times and measures of eleven strings, nursling
he of Miletus, the town of a twelve-walled people 2
that is chief among the Achaeans.

But to this city Ι pray thee come, thou Far-
darting Pythian with the gifts of prosperity and
a peace abounding in orderliness for an untroubled

people.
