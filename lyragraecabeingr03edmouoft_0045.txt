CORINNA

Scholiast on the Oclyssey: The account of Demetrius of
Phalerum is as follows :--Menelai'1s came to Delphi with
Odysseus and consulted the God about the coming Trojan
lVar, and it was then that the eight-yearly Pythian festival
was held by Creon, and the victor was the Laconian Demo-

write in epic verse of the battle of Amphitryon with the
Teleboans and the fight between the Cithaeron and Helicon
who gave their names to the mountains in Boeotia.

Cronus in the days after divine Rhea had deceived

Gods put their secret ballot-stones in the golden
urns, and all at once they rose, and the more part of
the votes was Cithaeron's. And quickly did H ermes’
loud cry proclaim that he had won delightful victory,
and the Gods adorned his head with wreaths,2 and
his heart was glad. But Helicon, he was whelmed
with bitter griefs, and tare out a smooth rock, and

miraculous feeding of the infant Zeus (at places which vary
