THE CYCLES ε HESIOD

the Iambic and Trochaic than in the Melie. The use of
Anapaestic rhythms for marching suggests that there
were two and not three steps to the Anapaest3 and the
Prosodiac for instance (z vvvvvv —)‚ clearly involved
an unsung step or musical rest of 0 whole foot between
each pair of lines. Yet that the foot once corresponded
with the syllable and not with two or more syllables, is
made probable both by the word itself and by the ultimate
identity of poetry and dance‚ considered with the par-
ticularly slow development of ⁶ resolution ’ in Melic verse,
which, otherwise so much more open to innovation than
the other forms, preserved its connexion with the dance
far longer and shows other signs of a greater antiquity.

When Greece emerges from the Dark Age which
followed the Age of the Heroes described by Homer,
this dimly-seen and hardly-to-be-measured time of
changes territorial, economic, political, we find the
Hexameter still the art-metre par emcellence, but it
has widened its scope. The Trojan CYCLE,1 some
of them of the school of Homer in Chios, but drawing
sometimes on material other than his, have begun
their work of filling the gaps in the Tale of Troy;
and we have traces also of a Theban Cycle concerned
with the two expeditioris against Thebes, and of
other Epic poetry such as the Titanomachy. These
poets mostly are the conservatives——the old con-
ventional metre and the old aristocratic themes-
The kings were mostly perhaps still kings, and doubt-
less liked 10 have bards singing at their table of the
deeds of their heroic ancestors. We hear of a king
Agamemnon of Aeolian Cyme, whose daughter was
married to Midas king of Phrygia.2 The name and
the marriage are both significant. Now this Cyme
not only plays a part in the traditions surrounding

the name of Homer, but was the city whence HESIOD’S ·

father emigrated to Boeotia3 and in Hesiod, kings,
by which are probably meant nobles, are oppressors

1 this name for a select body of poetry should be compared
with the κοινὴ περίοδος of Pindar's works (Arq. p. 6 Dr.); it-
more probably originated among the schoolmasters than
among the professors 2 the Dynasty of kings known to the
Greeks by this name came to an end in ’(05
