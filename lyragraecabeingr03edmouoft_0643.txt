‘ NEW '-LESBIAN FORMS

as in Pindar—from triad to triad, would hardly have been
possible. Moreover Greek music took account of the
pitch-accent, at any rate, it would seem, till the mid-
5th Century,² and this was ignored in Greek metre till
strcss began to resume its sway in the language. Tho
dance, on the other hand, where dance there was, could
remain essentially the same throughout, though there
could be, and doubtless was, much variety of action
without any change of the actual steps.

Other notable features of Lesbian poetry are the
frequency of alternatives such as ὅρρανος and ἔρανος,
which, however they should be spelt, may be reckoned
historically correct—both standing for ὅρΡανος; and the
lengthening of certain consonants for metrical purposes,
for instance ὀννώρινε. Both these features have their
parallels in Homer, where dialectical considerations point
to their belonging to the Aeolio clement. The metrical
lengthenings, at an)r rate, are in all probability survivals
of an early stage of Greek or pre-Greek poetry when the
rules of quantity had not worked themselves out, but
words were simply grouped roughly in rhythms. The
initial ‘ freedoms² ζ z or ζ, found in certain Aeolio lines
and also in Vedio poetry, may well be equally archaic.

‹ As in ordinary speech, rhythmic fixity doubtless began in

Greek poetry and its forbears at the end of the unit.
This rough grouping into rhythms is most easily con-
ceived of as taking place at a stage in the growth of the
language when stress was the predominant form of
accentuation, when the rhythms were stress-rhythms as
in the lyre (and piano), not length-rhythms as in the
fiute (and organ). And the fact that there were two
quintuple or five-time feet called Paeon, ————— and
ννν- (or —vvv), the first of which is conceivably that
of the earliest form of the refrain of the Paean, ιἠπαιᾶων,
can better be accounted for by supposing them twin
descendants of a foot of five beats than of five lengths.2

1 compare Dion. Hal. Comp. 11 on a ‘ chorus ' of Euripides
with the Delphian ‘ Hymns ’ to Apollo: this disregard of the
pitch-accent was clearly one of E.‘s innovations (cf. Ar. Froqs
1313 ff.) which was not followed by the conservatives; it
would tend to make it less easy for the audience to follow the
words, and doubtless contributed to the resuscitation of the
monodic, and therefore more easily intelligible‚ Lyre-Sung
Nome (see p. 673) ² cf. Aristox. ap. Ox. Pap. 9 col. 4, where
the possibility of a Paeon of five shorts is suggested
