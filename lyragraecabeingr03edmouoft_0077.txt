LIFE OF DIAGORAS

Hesychius of Miletus On Famous illm: Diagoras
son of Telecleides‚ when a slave, was observed by
Democritus of Abdera to be a promising fellow, and,
bought by him for ten thousand drachmas,1 became his
pupil. He devoted himself to lyric poetry. He
was nicknamed the Atheist because, when a fellow-
poet, whom he accused of taking a Paean he had
written, swore that he had not stolen it and then
won distinction by'having it performed as his own,
he wrote in his vexation the prose-work known as
T lte Tower QfDqfhn‘oe to mark his repudiation of his
religious beliefs.

Suidas Leoeicon : Diagoras z—Son of Telecleides or
of Teleclytus, of Melos, philosopher and writer of
songs . . .; he comes in point of time after Pindar
and Bacchylides but before Melanippides, and
flourished therefore in the 78th Olympiad (B.C.
468—465y2

Diodorus of Sicily Historz'cal Library : While these
events were taking place,3 Diagoras nicknamed the
Atheist fled from Attica under a false accusation of
impiety and in fear of his life, and the Athenian

lpeogle put the price of a talent of silvei-⁴² on his
ea .

[Lysias] Agaz'nst Andocides: The impiety of the
defendant is so far greater than that of Diagoras of
Melos, in that Diagoras' offence was one of words,
and was committed in respect of foreign rites and
festivals, whereas the defendant's is of deeds, and
committed in respect of the rites and festivals of his
native city.
