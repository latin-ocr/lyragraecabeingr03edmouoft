Priscian Principles of Grammar: In general, however, we
follow the Aeolians, who say θουγείτηρ for θυγάτηρ ‘ daughter‚'
with the diphthong short, or rather give the Greek υ the
value of the Latin u, and for that reason prefix ο in writing,
not making a diphthong but the Aeolic υς compare :

O daughter of that land of fair dances, Hyria 1
