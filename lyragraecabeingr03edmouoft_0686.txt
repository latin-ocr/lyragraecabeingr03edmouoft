THE EARLIER DITHYRAMB

of singers 3 the professional element did not reassert itself
till the over-elaboration of music made it imperative in
the 4th Century. It is recorded that Simonides was
victorious in the Dithyramb in 47 6, Pindar in 474.

In other ‘parts of Greece about the year 500 we find
Dithyrambs being composed by Praxilla of Sicyon, and
there is some trace of the art-Dithyramb before this in
Magna Graecia, though the claim that most of the poems
of Stesichorus were Dithyrambs is not to be regarded as
proved. They were more probably Lyre-Sung Nemes.

In 5th-Century Athens the change in the subject-
matter of the Dithyramb was resented by the conservative
element in the people, and ‘ What has this to do with
Dionysus? ’ became a proverb for irrelevance. Τ11θ only
considerable fragment of the Dithyrambs of Pindar, which
filled two Books, deals with Dionysus 3 but the only two
of Simonides' Dithyrambs of which we know the names
were called fllemnon and E urcpa ‚· and of the five complete
extant Dithyrambs of Bacchylides the Io is the only one
that mentions him, and tha-t only just at the end.l Both
Pindar’s fragment and the Io were written for the
AthenianS. Pindar tells us that the Dithyramb originated
at Corinth, and this seems to have been the scene of the
labours of Arion. In the same passage Pindar calls it
‘ ox-driving ⁹ (βοηλάτης), that is, for which the prize is
an ox. The Scholiast on Plato tells us that the winning
poet received an ox, the second a jar, presumably of wine,
and the third a goat which was led away anointed with
wine-lees. Athenaeus tells us that the winning Athenian
tribe received a tripod. This tripod was dedicated in the
Street of Tripods with an inscription recording the
archonship, the poet, the fiuteplayer, and the choragus or
rich citizen who had paid for the training and equipment
of the chorus. The fluteplayer stood on the steps of the
altar, and the chorus danced round it. The chorus was
of fifty men in the time of Simonides, later sometimes of
more, and was called circular probably in contrast at first
with the quadrangular processional song-dances such as
the Partheneia and the Prosodia, and later with the
similar formation which became usual in the Drama.
The musical mode employed was at first, as was to be

1 it is not necessary to suppose that the classing of these as
Dithyrambs is merely Alexandrian3 apart from the evidence
of the proverb, the ‘ absence ’ of Dionysus was a natural develop-
ment and has its parallel in the history of the Paean
