expressions, and so Aristophanes uses the same in emulation
of them. Thus he makes clear the unpleasantness these
authors show in their compounds owing to their disjointed·
ness.

prob. a play on Hermes and herma ‘post' or ‘cairn ⁵ the
δόλιχος or long-race was sometimes as much as 24 furlongs ;
in all but the shortest race the starting-post, was also the
turning-post
