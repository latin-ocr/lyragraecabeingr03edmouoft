THE ENCOMIUM

both may be Menodic. The better preserved of the two,
in which the Encomiologic metre predorninates, sings
of the pleasing effects of the wine-cup3 the other, which
is written in kindred rhythms, mentions an Olympian
victory. A more mutilated part of the same papyrus
would seem to indicate that Bacchylides’ Encomia some-
times contained a myth. We have mention of two
Eulogies of Diagoras, one of a Mantinean, the other of
Mantinea. This Eulogy of a state was doubtless per-
formed, like Pindar 5 xith‘jxe212e<1n,’ of which presently,
at a city· -banquet in the town- hall. The Eulogies of
Pindar formed his xiith Book, from which we have three
considerable fragments. By a lucky chance we have also
one complete Encomium included—apparently because
it mentions local victories in wrestling—in the Nemean
Epinicicz. Of these four poems, two are strophio and
two triadic; one begins with the Encomiologic, one has
it—with additions—at the end, and all are in kindred
rhythms. ⁶ Nemean ’ xi was sung and danced in praise
of Aristagoras of Tenedos after a public sacrifice and
feast on the occasion of his becoming president of his
city's council. It begins with an address to Hestia‚
whose sacred fire was kept burning in the town-ha113
wishes that Aristagoras may win favour by his year of
office3 congratulates his father on him, and himself on
his ‘ splendid body ’3 hints—by way of averting the
Nemesis that came, and still comes, of over-Praise 1—that
despite his beauty‚ wealth, and athletic prowess he is
nevertheless mortal3 yet adds that it is good that ‘ we ’
his fellow-citizens should tell his praise. Then comes the
reminder that he has won sixteen victories in the wrestling-
match among neighbouring peoples, and the assurance
that he would have been victorious at Pytho and Olympia
had his too diffident parents only thought fit to allow
him to compete there. Next, after a moralis-ing ‘ transi-
tion ’ to the effect that some men are ‘ cast out from good
things ' by boasting, others by mistrusting their strength,
follows a reference to his heroic ancestry; then more
moralising‚ on the heredity of virtues, how one generation
will have them and another not, for that it is destiny that
leads men on; Zeus gives us no clear sign of the future,

1 this precaution, a commonplace in Pindar, has its echo in
the modern Greek custom of averting the evil eye by spitting
in the face os a person whom you have praised
