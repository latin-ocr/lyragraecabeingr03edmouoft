SOURCES OF GREEK MUSIC

nected in any account with Thrace, is Amphion, who is
mentioned in the Odyssey as the founder of Thebes, where
his tomb and his tripod were shown to Pausanias.

Although Herodotus makes these early poets
posterior not only to Homer but to Hesiod, other
traditions placed them before the Dorian Migrations.
If they are historical, and most of them probably
are, they should perhaps be placed in the time of
the Achaean princedoms along with Demodocus and
Phemius with whom they are sometimes coupled.

Their foreign origin, if we may use the term of days
when the line between Greek and Barbarian was but
faintly drawn, implies that the Greeks, or at any rate the
people from whom they derived a large part of their
culture, were already in Greece, and should be considered
in connexion with such myths as those of the Telchines
and the Idaean Dactyls. Indeed Alexander Polyhistor‚
quoted by Plutarch M us. 5, ascribed the introduction of
instrumental music (κρούματα) to Olympus and the
Idaean Dactyls. This seems to be a combination of two
accounts. The Dactyls were the Phrygian priests of
Cybele and, according to tradition, great workers in iron.
The spread of a higher type of music, and probably this
means of poetry, seems to have coincided roughly with
the passing—doubtless very gradual—of the Bronze
Age. The other account used by Alexander apparently
ascribed the introduction of κρούματα to Olympus,
adding that the first fiuteplayer was Hyagnis who was
followed by his son Marsyas who was succeeded by
Olympus. This is the Marsyas who was said to have
been flayed alive as the result of a contest in music with
Apollo. The barbarity of the story is a mark of its great
age; Marsyas’ name is not Greek; and the scene of his
death is laid, like that of the activities of the Dactyls,
in Phrygia. The myth clearly reflects an early antagonism
between ‘ professional ’ wind and string‚ like that which
made Athena reject the flute when she saw the reflexion
of herself blowing it. It is indeed possible that the flute
as a ⁶ professional ’ instrument came in from Asia and
found the lyre‚ which had come from Thrace, already
installed in popular, or shall we say princely‚ favour.
But the great vogue of the flute in the conservative
Dorian communities of classical times shows that, if so,
