THE HYPORCHEME

Str. You hear him ! So he said just now or e’er high words
And zzgztznhze called Simonides a very sorry man.

And when I heard him Ι could scarce my rising wrath command;
Yet so I did and him Ι bid take myrtle in his hand

And-ebant 1 some lines from Aeschylus, but he replied with

The Drinking·Song was evidently an alternative to the
ῥῆσις or ‘ speech ‘ from Tragedy, and it was the host's part
to decide what form the entertaimnent should take. The
myrtle-branch (perhaps commemorative of the tyrannicides)
or a spray of laurei (connected probably with Apollo and
the Paean) was passed from hand to hand as the guests
took turns at recitation. WVhen singing was the order
of the day, the place of this branch was taken by the
lyre with which the singer accompanied his song. As
all the guests could not be expected, as a rule, to be able
or willing to sing, the lyre's course round the company was
often somewhat ‘ crooked '; hence, in contrast with the
regular course of the branch‚ the pmceeding, and after it
the song itself, was called σιεόλιαν.5 The entertainment
was sometimes varied by all the guests singing together,
for instance the Stanza ἲ’ἶ[”)ἰιιιί]ειιι μὲν ἄριστον ἀνδρὶ θνητῷς
but such were probably merely Monodic songs, as it were,
multiplied, and did not involve the dancing which was
characteristic, we may believe, of most Choral Melie.

A form of Choral Melic in which the dance pre-
dominated over the song was the HYPORCHEME.

This, once probably the ritual dance of the Curetes, was
said to have been introduced from Crete by Thaletas,
and to have been the accompanimcnt proper to the ἔνοπλος
