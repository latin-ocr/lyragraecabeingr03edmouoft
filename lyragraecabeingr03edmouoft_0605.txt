DANCE AND METRE

professional Athenians to sing and dance an unpunctuated,
or unevenly punctuated, succession of ‘ longs ' and
‘ shorts,' in which the grouping could make little or no
appeal to the lay ear. Another perhaps illuminating
consideration is, that the arrangement of Anapaests and
Iambi (or Trochees) in two-foot ‘ metra ’ would seem to
indicate 4-time rather than 2-time in the one case, and
6-time rather than 3-time in the other, and this grouping
surely implies a secondary ictus, as in our 6s8—ti1ne, half-
way through the ‘ metron ' or bar. If there was or had
been no ictus at all, why the contrast in nomenclature
with the Hexameter, where foot and metron are identical ἲ
For us this question of the nature of Greek metre has
some real importance. For with a very few exceptions‚
and those either late or fragmentary, we have lost ‘all
the music of Greek lyric3 and if we are to accept the
view that there was no ictus, let alone no equidistant
ictus, we, whose own poetry goes by stress, a stress that
in feeling if not in fact is equidistant‚ must in the nature
of things lose much of the rhythm as well. And yet the
φιλόρρυθμοι· reader of, say, an ode of Pindar, gets an
aesthetic pleasure from the rhythm3 and making all
allowance for undoubted difference of metrical associa·
tion between the Greeks and ourselves‚l this effect often ,
seems to suit the sense so admirably that it is hard to
believe it a mere phantom.²

ΤΗΕ NATURE or GREEK DANCING is mostly beyond our
present scope3 but certain consideratione may throw
some light on the early history of Greek metre. The use
of the word ‘ foot ’ in a metrical sense proves that, of the
bodily gestures of which ancient dancing consisted, the
most important was the movement of the feet, doubtless
because the feet strike the ground and so produce sound.
Its invariable use for a group of two or more syllables
and not for one syllable suggests that the step and the
syllable ceased to correspond at a very early stage. This

. stage seems to have been reached earlier in the Dactylic

and Anapaestic than in the other metres, and earlier in

1 for instance, despite the well· meant attempts of modern
composers of music for Greek plays, nothing can make a
choriambic metre solemn to the ear of Enghshmen, whose
ancestore disliked it so much that they inverted the adjective
as in ‘ the house beautiful,' ‘ the lady bountiful: and preferred
‘wife’s mother ’ to ‘mother-in-law’ 2 a good instance is the
speech of Jason, Pind. P. 4. 148 ff.
