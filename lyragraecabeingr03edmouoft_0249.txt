LIFE OF MELANIPPIDES

who make images which are without mind or motion,
or those who make living creatures capable of
thought and action?’

Aristotle Rlzeloric t In like manner, a long sentence
becomes a discourse in itself‚ like the purely instru-
mental parts of a song when they are too long.
Hence the satire of Democritus of Chios upon
Melanippides for making an instrumenta] interlude 1
take the place of the antistrophe :

He that does any ill to another does ill to himself,
but of all ills the worst to the doer is the long
interlude.2

The same stricture might well be made upon the
users of long clauses,

Plutarch That α Life lived according to Epicurus is
ηοί morth living.- For Hiero, surely, or Attalus, or
Archelaus could never have been brought to oust
from their festive table Euripides, Simonides,
Melanippides, or such men as Crates or Diodotus, in
favour of buffoons like Cardax, Agrias, or Callias, and
jazz-bandsmen like Thrasonides or Thrasyleon.

, and the narcissus of Melanippides big with
clear hymns.3
