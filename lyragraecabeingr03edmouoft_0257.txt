EURIPIDES

1-2 ermzv-SONG To ALcmiAnEsl

Plutarch Alcibiades: His horse-breeding was famous,
among other things, for the number of his racing-chariots.
He was the only man, not excluding kings‚ who ever entered
at Olympia as many as seven. And his winning not only
first place but second and fourth according to Thucydides—-
second and third according to Euripides—is the highest and
most honourable distinction ever won in this field. Euripides'
Ode contains the following passage:

But I will sing thy praises,2 son of Cleinias. A
noble thing is victory, noblest of the noble to do
what no Greek had ever done, be first and second

and third in the chariot-race, and go unwearied yet,
wreathed in the olive of Zeus, to make the herald

cry you.

The Same Demosthenes: The writer of the Eulogy of
Alcibiades for his victory in the horse-racc at Olympia,
whether as is commonly believed he be Euripides or another,
says:

Your happy man's first need is a famous country.

on HIERONYMUS

Aristophanes Acharnians : ‘Why all this havering and
shilly-shallying? For all Ι care, you may get the loan of one
of Hieronymus’ shady and shaggy Death-caps.' ¹
