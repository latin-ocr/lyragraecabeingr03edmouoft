Stobaeus Seloetions: From Porphyrius On the Styx :—The
rivers that are supposed to flow in Hades have been given
plausible names. Acheron is so called from ἄχη ‘pains’;
compare Melanippides in the Persephone:

And because it goeth pouring forth pains within
the bosom of Earth, it is called Acheron.

Athenaeus Doctors at Dz'mzer: Those who are ignorant of
the true power of wine say that Dionysus is the cause
of madness3 bui} this is the puresb slander. Compare
Melanippides :

And they all began 'co loathe urata-‚1 who had
never known wine before. Aye, it was not long
ere some were like to die and others were uttering
eries of frenzy.

The Same: Nicander of Colophon says that οἶνος, wine
gets its name from Oeneus: ‘Oeneus crushed grapes in
hollow cups and called ir, wine.' Compare also Melanippides :

O give me Oeneus' namesake wine.

Hear me, O Father, thou marvel unto men, ruler
of the everliving Mind.
