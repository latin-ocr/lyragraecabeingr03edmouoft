ALCMAN

forits effect more on rhythm and less on melody than modern
song. Indeed the lack of rhythmical variety probably
contributed much to the disuse of the Hexameter‚ the
Elegiae, and the Iambic, as song-metres; and it may be
that Melic took their place chiefly because, being as a new
art-form less bound by tradition, it was better able to
supply this very want. And the desire for the fullest
possible expression of this variety would emphasise the
importance of the dance. Another thing which gave
Melic an undoubted advantage, at any rate in solo per·
formances—and Epic, Elegiae, and Iambic were by this
time all monodic—was that the performer was his own
accompanist. This it is that with us causes from time to
time the vogue of a new stringed-instrument, the banjo
in the last generation, the ukulele in this.

The later writers of Elegiac and Iambic poetry,
HipponaX, Phocylides‚ Xenophanes, Theognis, do not
concern us here. It is enough to note, as a sign of the
times, that Xenophanes was a philosopher.

Turning now to the Lyrists, we find in the last
quarter of the 7th Century the most popular poet
of the Spartan Succession, ALCMAN, whose poems,
with the possible exception of Terpander's, alone
appear to have survived into Alexandrian times.
With Alcman—whose name is the Doric form of Alc-
maeon—Spartan pride showed itself, as with Tyrtaeus,
in the legend that made a foreigner into a native, and we
find in antiquity a conflict based on the disagreement
between the popular and literary traditions. It is not
unlikely that there was Lydian blood in his veins. There
appears to have been close intercourse between the
kingdom of Croesus and the Greek islands‚ notably
Lesbos, about this time, but whether Alcman came under
the native Lesbian influence as well as that of its offshoot
at Sparta is not clear.

His chief work would seem to have been choral,
and most of this composed for girl-choirs. Of the
Weddiny-Sonqs known to Leonidas of Tarentum no
trace survives. The Partheneia or Maiden-Songs were
closely akin to the Hymn in purpose, but there the
resemblance ceased.

The largest fragment is that of a poem which perhaps
