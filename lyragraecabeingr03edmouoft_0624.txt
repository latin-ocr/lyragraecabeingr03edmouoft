7 CHORAL AND MONODIC SONG

as μέλε’ ἠδ’ ἐλέγους Ἕλλησιν ἀείδων. And this seemingly
older meaning survived along with the other in the 5th
and 4th Centuries.1 It is not unreasonable, then, to
’ suggest that the word μέλος was applied to this sort of
poetry at a time when the three others, Epic, Elegiae,
and Iambic, had already become mere spoken verse. It
meant, in short, tune-poetry.

This poetry, in the very early time when all poetry
was normally sung, seems to have arisen as an art-
form in Lesbos. The tradition of the head of Orpheus

{eingf carried thither by the Hebrus refiects this
6 ie .

Metrically the outstanding difference between Melic
poetry and its contemporary art-forms of verse appears
to have been that it did not admit resolved feet. The
Hexameter and Elegiae, strictly speaking, did so neither,
but in them the poet often had the choice between
Dactyls and Spondees. It is in this choice that the
difference really lies. Early Melie had certain ‘ freedoms,‘
as we shall see, but no choice so wide as this, Its line
always has the same number of syllables. This peculiarity
cannot be dissociated from its longer adherence to the
dance. For Choral Melie remained song-dance right
through the Classical period. Resolution did of course
come in, but not for a long time. Melic poetry was divided
by 5th-Century custom into two categorieS, Choral or
χορῳδία and Monodic or μονῳδία. In the early days
this distinction would have been meaningless. In
Homer the lyre-player sings and plays to lead the dance;
the dancers also sang in certain forms of early Greek
poetry, always perhaps in the very earliest3 but except
in the Paean of I liad i. 472, the musico-poetical part of
the performance centres, for Homer, in the minstrel,
and the dance, if there be one—and that ‘ if ' is the
beginning of Monodic poetry—seems to be an impromptu
reflexion of his words and music, in which the amateurs,
if we may so call them, were led by two tumblers. This
technjcal subordination of the dance, which had led even
in Homer to Monodic or solo performances without it,
was probably connected with the development of the
Hymn and its secular offshoot, if such it were, the Epic.
