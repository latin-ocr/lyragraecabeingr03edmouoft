Plutarch On Music: In general, if we are to argue
ignorance of a use from its not being employed, we
shall condemn for ignorance many artists of the
present day,-—for instance, the Doro-Ionics who
despise the Antigenidean style, and the Antigeni-
deans who despise the Doro-Ionic3 neither school
uses the style of the other. Similarly we shall con-
demn for ignorance the lyre-singers who despise the
style of Timotheus 3 these have practically returned 2
to the ‘patchwork' music and the compositions of

Polyidus.

Athenaeus Doctors at Dimzer recorded sayings of
Stratonicus from Callisthenes : When PolyIdus
boasted> one day of his pupil Philotas' defeat of
Timotheus, Stratonicus exclaimed ‘I am surprised
that you do not know that Philotas writes bills
presented and Timotheus acts passed.’ 3
