THE HYMN

have written the 5th. The reader feels somehow
that Bacchylides‘ charms are embroidered on his
theme, while Pindar’s are inwoven in it. His beauty
is of the earth, Pindar's 01 the waters under the
earth. ‘Man is the dream 01 a shadow’3 101· all
his power as a narrator, Bacchylides could not have
written that.

Before we continue our story it will be convenient
to give some account 01 the various kinds 01 Μ6110
poetry. Of the history 01 the HYMN down to the
days 01 Terpander we have spoken already.

In Roman times Hymns were classified as εὐκτικοί ‘ of
prayer, ' ἆπευκτικοί ‘of deprec nation, ’ κλητικοί ‘ of invoca-
tion,’ ἆποπεμπτικοί ‘of valediction) The first would
correspond with Simonides’ Book 01 κατευχαί or Prayers.
The last, 01 which the ancients had examples in
Bacchylides, would be used 101· instance at Delphi when
Apollo withdrew for his winter sojourn in the land 01 the
Hyperboreans. The Cletic Hymn is exemplificd by
opening lines addressed to Aphrodite by Alcman and
Sappho, and one or other 01 the types in the fragments of
the H stnns to Hermes and Athena by Alcaeus; in a perhaps

probably the first< six stanzas 01 Α1066115’ H ymn ιο Apollo:

and some fragments 01 the Hymns 01 Bacchylides and Pindar.
Sappho’s Ode ιο Aphrodite, like Anacreon's to Dionysus, is
apparently an adaptation 01 the Hymn to the purposes of
a Love-Song or Love-Message. These few instances, none
of which, except the two Love-Songs, is necessarily to be
considered monodic, are sufficient to give some idea of the
Hymn 01 the early classical period. Catullus’ Hymn ιο
Diana,- Horace’ s Carmen Saeculares and some of the
odes, 101· instance those ιο M ercury (1. 10), ιο Venus (i. 30),
ιο Diana (iii. 22); and the Hymns 01 Tragedy and
Comedy‚ 101· instance the beautiful invocation to the
Clouds 111 the play of Aristophanes3 will help to fill out the
picture. The earliest extant non· hexameter fragment of a
Hymn 15 a 11116 from one to Demeter included in the
ἰΙόβακχο 01 Α1011110011115. The connexion of these Hymns
with the Homeris Η ymm is marked by the use of the
word Proem for the Homeric H ymn ιο Apollo by Thucydides,
