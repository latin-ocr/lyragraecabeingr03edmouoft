POLYIDUS

Upon (ι stone found near Teos: Whereas Herodotus
son of Menodotus and Menecles son of Dionysius
have been sent ambassadors from Teos to the cities
of Crete and have spent most of the time allowed
them in our city, and have not only shown the
good behaviour expected from visitors, but one of
them, to wit Menecles, as became a man of culture,
has given sundry tasteful perfornialices to the lyre,
as well of the works of Timotheus and Polyidus as of
our own classica] poets; it is resolved by the
Directors and City of Cnossus that, in order that
the Teians may know that the City has accepted the
embassy of the ambassadors aforesaid, thanks be
tendered to the city of Teos for sending the same,
and likewise to the ambassadors Herodotus and Mene-
cles for their excellent behaviour during their visit.

Ecymoloqicum Magnum: Atlas: A mountain of Libya.
The dithyramb-writer Polyidus makes him out to have been

being allowed to pass) was asked by him who he was and
whence he came3 whereupou, being unable to gain his per-
mission by force of words, he must needs show him the

Gorgon's head and turn him to stone3 and thus the mountain
came to be called after him Atlas. This account is given by

Lycophron in h Gom mentary.
