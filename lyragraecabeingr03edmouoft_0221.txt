BACCHYLIDES'

Stobaeus Excracts on Physics [on Destiny and the Orderli-
ness of Events]: Bacchylides :—

Neither prosperity, nor stubborn war, nor all-
destructive civil strife, eometh to us of our choice,
but Destiny that giveth all, she bringeth down a
cloud now on this land and now on that.

491

clement of Alexandria M iscellanies : Bacchylides :—

F ew are the mortal men whom God hath granted
to be so fortunate all their days as to reach the
time of gray temples without meeting trouble.

Plutarch Lzsfe of Numa: Can we then, if we admit these
instanees of divine favoni, refuse to believe that men like
Zaleucus and Minos and Zoroaster and Numa and Ly curgus
were visited by the Divine Power while they were guiding
kingdoms and §regulating polities⁹ 01 is it reasonable to
suppose that Gods are in jes bl? when they consort with such
persons to their edification‚ buta in earnest in their deal·
ings, if such they have, with poete and warblers to the lyre. ⁴²
Yet, to quote BacchylideS,

If any say otherwise, broad is 'che path.

For the other view is worthy consideration, etc.
