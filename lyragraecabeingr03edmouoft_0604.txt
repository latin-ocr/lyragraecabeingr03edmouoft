THE NATURE OF GREEK METRE

pre-Greek had more of the nature of a stress-language—
whether or no this time was identical with the very early
period which produced the ‘weak' forms of ‘ roots '
exemplified by δί- -φρ -os beside φέρ- -.ω

That the Hexameter, or the elements out of which it
grew, was originally a stress- metre, is perhaps suggested
by its never admitting resolution of one long syllable
into two short, and by such Homeric scansions as ᾶνδροτῆτα
and φῑλη. It is significant that Aeolio verse, which, as
we shall see, shows elements of greater antiquity than
the Hexameter, is equally unfavourable to resolution3
admits ictus-lengthening—if such it be——of certain con-
sonants3 and, as might be expected in the early stages
of a language which preferred σοφώτερος to σοφότερος,
eschews the succession of three short syllables. The
strange contentment of classical Attio with such a form
as στενότερος (due to the word's having been originally
στενΡός) shows a change in the feeling of its speakers 1
which, whether actually contemporaneous with it or not,
can hardly be dissociated from the spread² of resolved
feet from Iambic- Trochaic into Melie metres.²

If Greek metre was originally a stress- metre, it does
not perhaps necessarily follow that it involved ‘equi-
distant stress, ’ that is, that it was divisible into equal
‘'bars ;,but other considerations apart, Homer' s mentions
of beating time assuredly point this way for the folk-
music, and the use of the κρούπεζα3 fory the later art-
music. Eventually no doubt, just as it became adsnissible
to shift the ictus, the equidistance could be broken on
occasion and even frequently, as it is in the Elizabethan
madrigals‚4 but, as in our blank verse, the underlying
sense of it must always, one would think, have been
there. Despite the half-parallel of our own plain-song,
it is hard to believe that the Greek poet-musicians of the
6th and 5th Centuries, whom Aristoxenus speaks of as
φιλόρρυθμοι in contrast with the φιλομελεΐς of his own
day, should have habitually taught a chorus of fifty non-

1 the later working of the change appears in the fact, estab-
lished by de Groot that Demosthene-s avoids groups (a) of more
than tw o ‘ shorts ' and also (b) of more than two ‘ longs, ' whereas
