SIMONIDES

The Kinqdom os Cam-byses and Darius, Tha Sea-fimet with
Xerxe-s, The Sea-siylzt off Artemisium ; as his most famous
lyric poem The Sea-fiyht at Salamis3 and includes among
his works a Book of Traqeclies. His Ἀτακτοι Λόγοι were

Marathon and Plataea. Af’nong the Inscripffions, besides
War-Epitaphs, are lines for the tomb of the daughter of
HippiaS, for one of the Alcmaeonids, for the runner Dandes
of Argos, for Lycas a Thessalian hound. The same Book
contained dedications for votive-offerings for victories over
Chalcis, over the Persians off Artemisium, over the Car-
thaginians at Himera and the Etruscans off Cumae3 for
the altar of Zeus Eleutherios at Plataea3 for the statues of
winning athletes3 for a painting by Polygnotus at Delphi.1

None of Simonides’ Melic poetry seems to have
been Μο110(110.Ι11 the fragments of his Choral works
we find for the first time the common Lyric dialect
of speech—and one may almost add, of metre—
which seems, like the common Epic dialect which
generations before had been the first literary expres-
sion of the unity of the Greek race, to have 6118611 68
part of the new emphasis in that unity brought about
by the Persian WVars.

Neither in speech, metre, nor structure is 1511616 61157
notable distinction 150 be made between these fragments
and the ‘ choruses ’ of Attio drama. Some of the Epitaphs
show Doric forms rather 1511611· the traditional Ionio when
they are written for Dorians3 the Melic dialect does not
vary. Here too for the first time we find the Triad in
its full development with strophes eight or 111116 111168
long. Side by side with it we find, as in Pindar, the
strophio arrangement; here also the strophes are longer
than hitherto. These changes in the direction of greater
elaboration should be considered in connexion with the
musical reforms of Lasus, and the statement of the
8011011681, 011 Pindar that the ‘ originator ’ of the dancing-
chorus was Arion of Methymna (at Corinth), who was
followed (seventy years later) by Lasus.

1 some at least, probably all the best, of the Simonidean
Inscriptions printed in vol. ii are to be ascribed to Simonides3
the fashionable doubt of their genuineness 18 chiefly due to
misunderstanding of Herodotus (see vol. ii, p. 353 n.)
