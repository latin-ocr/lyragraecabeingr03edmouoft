DIAGORAS
LIFE

Aristophanes Frogs: XANTHIAS to DroNYsus: Here
we are, sir3 the initiates he told us of are at their
games hereabouts. They’re singing the Iacchus
which they sing through the market-place.1

Scholiast on tlze passage: Diagoras was an atheist
lyric poet who like Socrates introduced new
deities. According to Aristarchus, Aristophanes
does not introduce Diagoras here singing of the
Gods‚ but uses the word ‘singing' ironically for
‘jeering at] ‘putting to scorn.’ So the poet is
inciting the Athenians‚ who accordingly condemned
Diagoras on the charge of blasphemy, and offered
the reward of a talent to any who should put him to
death, and two talents to any who should take him
alive, calling upon the Pellanians to do one or the
other. Compare Craterus in his Collection of the
Decrees. This Diagoras was a Melian, the son of
Teleclytus, and belongs to the time of Simonides
and Pindar. According to other comment-ators,
among them Apollodorus of Tarsus, the reading is
δι’ ἀγορᾶς ‘ through the marketplace,’ etc.

The Same Birds: CHoRus: On this day of all *days

there’s proclamation made that whoever of you
Athenians shall kill Diagoras the Melian‚ shall re-

have been substituted as a joke, if it was not a corruption
due to the same cause
