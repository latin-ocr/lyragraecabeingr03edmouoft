THE LATER DITHYRAMB

expected, the Phrygian. The structure of a Dithyramb
in ἵζε best period was sometimes strophic, sometimes
tria 'c.

We have evidence of the authorship of Dithyrambs
at this time for Ibycus, Lasus, Simonides, Lamprodcs,
Pindar, and Bacchylides. Of the five completo extant
Dithyrambs of Bacchylides the subjects are The Asking-
back of Helen, Heracles and the Shirt of Nessus, Theseus'
Voyage to Crete, Theseus' First Coming to Athens, The
WVanderings of Io. Of these the Voyag'e of Theseus was
performed in honour of Apollo at Delos by a chorus of
Ceans, the Heracles in honour of Apollo at Delphi3 the
First Coming of Theseus is clearly for the Athenians ; the
10 is definitely stated to be for the Athenians ; the frag-
mentary I das is for the Lacedaemonians.

With the growing importance of musio in Melic
performances, against which Pratinas of Phlius pro-
tested in vain (p. 660 above), and to which we have
references in Aristophanes (Nub. 970), came a still
completer separation of the Dithyramb from the
Drama. The Drama became less and less a matter
of song and dance, and the Dithyramb more and more
a matter of instrmnental music.

We may realise this by comparing the proportions of
Melic to other matter in Aeschylus and Euripides. The
accompaniment of the Dithyramb now included the lyre,
and the dancing of the Dithyrambic chorus was greatly
elaborated. The music-and-dancing element once strong
in both Drama and Dithyramb was now concentrated in
the Dithyramb, and the verbal clement once equally

ramb, but the over-elaboration of the dancing and the
music caused degeneration in the style of the words and a
loss of form in the metre. The strophio arrangement
disappeared3 all the ‘ modes ’ were used in the same
poem3 the words became a turgid jumble of disjointcd
sentences full of wildly-compounded epithets.

· Soon the performance became too much for the

citizen-choruses, and professionalism resumed its
sway. The comio poets and Plato protested in vain.
The truth is that all the Dionysiae performances‚
including the Drama, suffered the degeneration which
