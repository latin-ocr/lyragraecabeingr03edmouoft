the fragments 01 Mimnermus resemble those of Archi-
lochus in combining the general with the persona13 and
in reading them we feel ourselves in the presence of the

Mimnermus has been called the father 01 1113
Ε10110 Elegy. The two streams Iambic and Elegiae
unite 101· 1113 1331 time in the first t-ruly Athenian poet,

suffice to add that Solon answercd Mimnermus’ wish
that he might die without disease or trouble at the
age of siXty, with a poem requesting him to read for
sixty, eighty—a story which is 11331111 33 marking the
Ionian origins 01 Α1110 literature, and as illustrating

Thus the spheres 01 Elegiae and Iambic have by

probably by that time to some extent dropped the
music‚1 becoming, like the Epic, mere recitation—verse,
but often still accompanied by an instrument whose
rhythm was followed by the reciter. This change
would naturally tend 10 bring the two kinds together.
Melie still held apart, and though, as we shall see, it
was not always sung, preserved so strongly the
traditional connexion 01 poetry with music and the
dance that it actually appears to have restored the
dance clement to the sphere 01 311.
