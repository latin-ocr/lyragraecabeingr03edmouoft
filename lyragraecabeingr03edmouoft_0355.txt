Athenaeus Doctors ab Dinner [on Love] ε According to
Licymnius of Chios, Sleep loved Endymion and would not
close his beloved’s eyes when he slept‚ but put him to sleep
with his eyes wide open, so that he might enjoy the pleasure
of gazing on them perpetually. His words are these:

Because he rejoiced in the light of his eyes, Sleep
laid the lad to rest with lids wide open.

Parthenius Romances: On Nauis : from the lyric poet
Licymnius of Chios and Hermesianax z—It has been said by
some authorities that the citadel of Sardis was taken by
Cyrus king of the Persians through the treachery of Croesus’
daughter Nanis. Cyrus had been besieging the city without
getting any nearer to taking it, and was greatly afraid that
its allies might rally to Croesus' aid and destroy his army,
when this girl, according to the story, came to a compact
with him to betray the town if he would marry her accord-
ing to the laws of the Persians, and with the help of certain
men whom she made privy to her plan, admitted the enemy
to the summit, where no guards were placed owing to the
natural strength of the ground. Cyrus nevertheless refused
to keep the promise he had made her.
