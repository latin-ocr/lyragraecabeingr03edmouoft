LICYMNIUS

Scholiast on the passage: Licymnius was the
teacher of Polus; he divided nouus into proper,
compound, cognate, epithet, and other.

Dionysius of Halicarnassus The Fine T eclmiqne
of Demosthenes [on Plato]: And as if this were not
enough, in the very next sentence there is an
example of the same thing: ί We require a speech
which will give the dead adequate praise and the
living kindly exhortation.' Does not adverb con-
trast with adverb and verb with verb, ‘adequately ’
with ‘ kindly ’ and ζ praise ' with ⁴ exhortation '? are
not these examples of ‘balance'? And these are
not the phrases of a Licymnius or an Agathon with
their (ὕβρις or Κύπρις,’ ‘outrage or Love,' their
⁶ μισθῷ ποθέν,’ ‘ drunken with bribes ’ or ζ with 11111165
from somewhere,’ and their μόχθον Ἀτρειδῶν, ⁶ labour
of the Atreidae,' 1 but of ,the divine expositor, Plato.
