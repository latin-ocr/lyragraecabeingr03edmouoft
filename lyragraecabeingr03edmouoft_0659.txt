TELESILLA

attacked in it Simonides' friend Themistocles. It is
a triadic poem, and therefore probably Choral,
written in a much more pronounced Doric than that
of the Attio ‘ choruses,' and was probably sung and
danced, like Simonides’ Victory-Sonq sor Scopas, at a
drinking-party. The Eulogy here masquerades as a
lampoon.

Timocreon’s poem in Ionio dimeters beginning ‘Quoth
a pretty man of Sicily to his mother,’ and his monodic
Drinking-song in Trochaic dimeters to the God of Riches,
suggest that he is indebted, if not for form, at least for
matter, to Alcaeus. He seems to have quoted an Iambic
line of Anacreon’s. Like Simonides, he also wrote
Inscriptions. Of his Comedies, like Simonides' Tragedies,
nothing is known except the statement of Suidas that he
wrote them.

,Another poet of this age who seems to have com-
bined ‘ pure ’ lyric and the drama was Phrynichus,
whose 'first tragic victory was in 511, and who is
recorded by Timaeus as a writer of Paeans.1 Thus
in the first quarter of the 5ch Century signs are
already visible of a change in the history of Greek
Melie. The lyric genius of Athens is soon to run in
but two channels, the Dithyramb and the Drama.

Before we continue the account of Lyric at the
new literary metropolis we have to speak of four
poets, two Pan-Hellenic and two provincial, the latter,
whom we shall take first, both wholly or in part
Dorian, and both—a thing hardly to be expected in
Ionian Athens—women. The noble figure of TELE-
SILLA of Argos shines for us in the pages of Pausanias
and Plutarch, but as a poet, or rather a prophet,
turned warrior. Of her poetry we know hardly more
than that, like another Dorian, Timocreon, she used
the Doric dialect and sometimes the Ionic measure,
and that she wrote what was perhaps a Partheneion
to Artemis and probably a Hymn to Apollo.
