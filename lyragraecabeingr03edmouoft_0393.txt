LIFE OF PHILOXENUS OF CYTHERA

he told the story of Philoxenus and the brickmakers.
One day Philoxenus found the brickmakers singing
a song of his own badly, and immediately trampled
the bricks they were making underfoot, exclainiing,
‘ As you destroy things of mine, I destroy things of
yours.

Appendix to Stobaeus Antkology [from the Traeis
of Aristonymus and from Socrates]: The musician
Philoxenus, when asked what was the chief aid to
education, replied ‘ Time.’

The Same [from the works of Democritus, Epic-
tetus, and other philosophers, poets and orators]:
Philoxenus advised us to honour our teachers more
than our parents, because our parents cause us to
live but our teachers to live well.

Suidas Lexicon: Antigeneides :—Son of Satyrus3
of Thebes; a musician3 Philoxenus’ singer to the
flute. He was the first to wear Milesian shoes;
and in the Reveller he wore a yellow cloak. He
wrote lyric poemS.1

Aristotle Politia-3: All revelry and all similar
forms of excitement belong, of all instruments, to
the flute, and receive their proper expression, of
all the ‘modes,’ in the Phrygian. Thus the
Dithyramb appears to be admitted on all hands
to be a Phrygian form; and of this many proofs
are offered by competent authorities, notably
Philoxenus' failure to compose his Dithyramb The
stIysians in the Dorian mode, for he was driven
by the nature of the case to fall back on the
appropriate mode, the Phrygian.
