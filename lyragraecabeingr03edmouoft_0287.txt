PRONOMUS

reason there were fiutes peculiar to each ‘1node‚’ and in the
competitions every flate-player had flutes adapted to each.
The first to play all the modes on one pair of flntes was
Pronomus of Thebes. But nowadays the art of music is
pursued in a randoln and inconsiderate way.

Planmlean Antholoyy Anonymous :—

Greece judged Thebes to be first in playing the flute, and
Thebes Pronomus son of Oeniades.1

Pausanias Description of Graece [the temple of Apollo at
Thebes]: And there is a statue there of Pronomus, a flute-
player who had great charm for the vulgar . . . It was he
who invented flutes that were suited to any mode, and first
played tunes differing in this respect on the same pair of
flutes. We are told too that his facial expression and the
versatility of his bodily movements used to bring down the
house. Moreover there is a song composed by him for the
Chalcidians on the Euripus, a Processional to Delos. Of
him then it was and Epameinondas son of Polymnis that
the Thebans set up statues in this place.

The Same [On the founding of Messene by Epameinondas] :
That day was devoted to sacrifices and prayerS. On the
following days they began to build the wall round the city,
and houses and temples within it. The work was done to the
accompaniment of no music but that of Boeotian and Argive
flutes, and there was keen competition between the melodies
of Sacadas and those of Pronomus.

Aristophanes Ecclesiazusae:

And if we sit in front we shall not be noticed so long as
we gather up our cloaks ; and when we show the beards we
shall put on there, everybody that sees us will think we are
men. Why, Agyrrhius is never found out in Pronomus’
beard ; and yet he was a woman once, though now, as you
see, he's the biggest man in Athens.

Scholia-st οη the passaqe: Agyrrhius was a general of
effeminate character who had commanded in Lesbos. He
cut down the pay of the poets and was the first to pay
members of parliament. Pronomus was a flute-player who
had a great. beard. Agyrrhius was addicted to unnatural vice.
