TIMOTHEUS

6 Tus anTn-PANGS or SEMELicl

The Same [Callisthenes re111iniscences of StratonicusJ:
After hearing the Birth-panys of Timotheus he remarkcd ‘ If
she had been brought to bed of a stage-carpenter 2 instead of
a God, she couldn’t have made inore noisc.' ³

Alcaeus of Messene z Mingling harmonicus voice with tender
flutes, Dorotheus piped of the woeful Τι’0]“6113,4 and of the light-
ning-made Birth-pangs of Semele, piped of the prisoners of the
Horse,⁵ embracing withal the everliving Graces; and alone
among the holy prophcts of Dionysus escaped the swift
wings of Blame—a. Theban he, son of Sosicles; and so
dedicated his mouth-band and reeds in the temple of
Lyaeus.

Dio Chrysostom Orations [on envy]: Nor again was
Alcmaeon, the man who was so handsonlely treated by
Croesus, envied by Solon or by any other of the wise men of his
day. Permitted one day by the great Lydian to enter his
treasury and take away as much gold as he 1111611, Alcmaeon
went to work so manfully on the royal bounty as to goin
dressed in a flowing gown with a full sold at the breast like
a woman's and shod in boots purposely made much too large
for him, and ended by powdering his hair and his beard with
gold-(lust and filling his mouth and both his cheeks with it,
and when he came out could scarcely walk, like a flute-player
performing The Birth—panqs of Senzelb, much to the amuse-
ment of Croesus and his Lydians. And, Weight for weight,
Alcmaeon was not worth at that time a single clrach1na.⁶

Aristotle Rlzetoric: The opening of a declamatory speech
may consist of pmise, blame, exhortation, dissuasion‚ or a
direct appeal to the audience ; for that which gives the key-
note of the speech must be relevant or irrelevant. A juridical
speech, on the other hand, must have an opening analogous in
function to the prologue of a play or the preludc of an epic.
The Dithyramb of course resembles in this respect the
declamation ; compare:

of Troy ⁵ oze. the Wooden Horse ⁶ cf. Hdt. 6. 125,
Plat. Jeep. 3731)
