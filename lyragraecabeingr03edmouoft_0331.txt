TIMOTHEUS

⁶4]- my grave in a land unknown.1 I am all entrapped,
shut off from finding any pathway out by a barrier
innumerable of ships. Not even a fish, dashing to
and fro about this wreckage, could escape the fiet-ce
trackings-down of these Mede-murdering swirls.'2
And as often as the breath failed him, there would
break in upon him a spumy rain unblent with the
wine-God3 and pour into the channel of his meat 3
and whenever the back-thrown brine seethed over
from his mouth, with accents hoarse and wits dis-
traught, in impotent anger gnashing his teeth he
would storm and rage at the sea that was the
despoiler of his life, saying: ‘Already, for all thy
arrogance, hast thou had thy turbulent neck bound
in a hempen fetter,4 and now my king, mine, shall
muddy thy depths with mountain-born pines and shut
up thy floating plains within wandering coasts,5 thou
frenzied thing of olden hate,6 faithful minion of the
billow-coursing gale.' 7 So spake he all fordone with
