ANONYMOUS: LATER POETS

The Same: The foot which consists entirely of short

syllables and is called by some writers the Tribrach‚ of which
the following is an example :

Dinning, spem-bearing, furious, war-clattered,
Father Ares

is mean and undignified and ignoble‚ and can be used to
compose nothing that is noble.

98

The Same: The foot which is made of a long and two
shorts and has the long in the middle is called the Amphi-
brach, and is not a particularly beautiful rhythm, being

enervating and smacking strongly of the effeminate and
ignoble; for instance

Thriambic² Iacchus, thou leader of this chorus

99

The Same: The writers on rhythm, however, declat-e that
the long of the Dactyl is shorter than a full long, and being
unable to say by how much, they call it ‘ irrational.' There
is another foot having the converse rhythm to this, which
begins with the shorts and ends with the irrational. This
they distinguish from the Anapaest and call it ‘cyclic‚'
giving the 'following example:

The high-gated city lies scattered o’er the ground.

100

The Same [the Cretic]: If the two longs come at the
beginning and the short at the end, like this:

1who shares altars with thee, O Phoebus, and the
h uses

vzelhave a manly type of rhythm suitable to the dignified
s y e.

¹ cf. Keil An. Gram. 8. ll, Macrv Sat. l. 19. 1 (may have
taken Βρόμιε as Dionysus and Ἀρη as an appellation‚ but in
that case the other epithets would be characteristic of D.
not of A.) ² the meaning of the epithet is unknown
