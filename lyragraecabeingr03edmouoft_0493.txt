ANONYMOUS: LATER POETS

that ‘ crowd of the unco’ wise,' those ‘ subtle thinkers beggars
after all,' 1 and others galore, are proofs of an ancient fcud.
Nevertheless we will admit once for all that if the poetry
whose end is to please, and by that I mean all ‘ imitation ³ 01·
art-representation of the sort, could give reason to prove
that she had a proper place in a well-constituted state, we,
at any rate, should welcome her back with open arms,
because we know what an effect she has upon us; but till
then, as religious men, we cannot betray what seems to us
the truth.

Plato Lclters: This poem, too, is approved by sensible
11161ὶῖ

Not glorious gold so rare in this mortal life of
disappointment, nor dianionds, nor silver couches,
shine in the eyes in comparison of a man, nor are
the rich-laden sels-sufficient fields of the wide-set
earth of such account as the unanimous thinking of
good men and true.

Stobaeus Selections [on Fortune or Chance] :

Fortune, beginning and end of morta] man, thou
sittest in the seats of wisdom and puttest price on 2
human deeds. More good than ill comes of thee,
and grace shineth around thy golden wing. That
which is given of thy scales turns out the happiest3
thou findest a way out amid the woes of perplexity,
and leadest like a light shining in the darkness, thou
most excellent of Gods.
