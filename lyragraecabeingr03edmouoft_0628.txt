ΡΟ YLMNASTUS : THALETAS t TY RTAEUS

I-Iigh-pitched.1 He was also credited with Proems or
Preludes, that is Hymns to be followed by Epic Lays,
the first-known Scolia or Drinking-Songs, and innov-
ations in rhythm. The Nomes and Proems will be
dealt with later (pp. 673ff.).
On the strength of its metrica] similarity to his Spondaic
‘ Hymn ⁹—probably a Proem—‚ the ancient view that
Terpander invented Drinking-Songs, and the belief that
the Spondaic rhythm was so called from σπονδαί
‘ libations‚’ editors sometimes ascribe to him the Mbation
F l ατε-8οης] to the Muses and Apollo. A fragment to the
Dioscuri written in molossi (— — —) is perhaps his.
There is no trace in Terpander of Iambic or Elegiae,
or of the Aeolic rhythms of Sappho and Alcaeus. We
unfortunately possess too little of Terpander’s work
to do more than take his ancient reputation on trust.

The Scolion-tradition was probably carried on by
a poet in the same list, the Ionian POLYMNASTUS,
whose merry and perhaps obscene Flute-songs were
sung at Athens in the time of Cratinus. Polymnastus
followed the lead of Olonas, whom Plutarch describes
as ‘ the first composer of Flute—sung Nomes and
Processional songs,’ and includes with him among the
authors of the seven traditional Nomes sung to the
flute. To some of the same poets are ascribed Paeans
and Elegies. One of them, Thales or THALETAS of
Gortyn, who seems to have been the great poet of
Crete, was said to have imitated Archilochus, and also
to have resuscitated the Paeonio and Cretic rhythms,
both of which involve quintuple time, from the old
fiute-music of Olympus. That this music still
existed, if we could but be sure that there was not a
second Olympus, would prove a tradition stretching
back into the Dark Age. But the Olympus imitated
by Thaletas is perhaps not so ancient.

A famous Spartan poet of this period was probably
a native of Aphidnae in Attica, TYRTAEUS, called by·
Suidas’ authority a writer of Elegy and a fluteplayer.
This was doubtless his chief fame in the later antiquity,
but he also composed for the choruses.
