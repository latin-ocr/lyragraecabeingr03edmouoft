LIFE OF BACCHYLIDES

Etymologicum stlagmcm z Meidylus : the name of the
father of Bacchylides, and it is derived from μειδιῶ
‘to smile' as Pheidylus from φειδώ ‘thriftff

Scholiast on Pindar [‘skilled is the man who
knoweth much by nature, they that have but
learnt—even as a pair of crows, gluttonous in their
wordiness, these chatter vain things against the
divine bird of Zeus']: (a) This is directed against
Bacchylides, who had in a way become a competitor
in the same arena. (b) He is hinting at Bacchy-
lides and Simonides, calling himself an eagle and
his rivals crOWS.

The Same [‘ the eagle is swift among winged
things, and though he chase it from afar he quickly
taketh his quari-y all bloody in his claws; but the
chattering daws have a lower pasturage']: That is,
my rivals in art resemble jackdaws, only shrieking
and feeding at lower levels, and cannot rise to
the heights. He appears to be directing this at
Bacchylides, with whom he had a feud, and compares
himself to an eagle and Bacchylides to a jackdaw.

The Same [‘but I must shun the overmuch biting
of slander '] ε He is hinting at Bacchylides, who was
always traducing him to Hiero.

The Same [“‘Pretty,'’ say the children to an
ape, “pretty thing,’' but Rhadamanthus, etc.’]:
(a) According to some authorities this is directed
against Bacchylides, who was in high repute with
Hiero. . . , (b) It may be intended thus: Bacchylides
appears in the eyes of children a man of skill, but
not in the eyes of grown men.
