PHILOXENUS SON OF ERYXIS

Phaonl—deseribes the provision made for a feast in the
following terms ε

In came pairs of lads with shining-faced tables,2
one for these of us, another for those, till the house
was full. And each table glistened in the rays ot
lofty lamps, crowned thick as they were with dish
and side-dish and a concourse of platters, luxuriant
all with the manifold inventions of the art of good
living, baits of the soul. Others meanwhile brought
baskets of snow-complexioned loaves, and for the
first course came no tureen, my sweet sir, but a nail-
studded charger,3 the greatest in the world, was
laden with the finest imaginable, irresistible, gleam-
ing, eel, a conger to wit, vomiting sorb-apples,
a dish for a Godl4 and yet on its heels came
another as large, and a turbot thereon great as a
cart-wheel. And little tureens there were t00, the
one of shark cutlets, the other of ray, aye and
another dish there was teeming with tender squid
