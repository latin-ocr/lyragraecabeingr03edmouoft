THE NOMES OF TERPANDER

the main body of the νόμος; but the two together were
still sometimes spoken of as a προοίμιον, and Ter-
pander’s Preludes in this sense contained some reference,
as Plutarch implies, to their being followed by Epic Lays—
as indeed, according to Heracleides, they originally were.
The ascription to Timotheus of a Book of Προνόμια or
Preludes to N omes seems to indicate the late use of a more
distinctive name for the προοίμιον νόμον. The Flute-
Sung Nome ‘invented ’ by Clonas may well have begun as
an occasional substitute for the Lyre—Sung. Of the two
purely instrumental Nomes both were probably develop-
ments of the few bars which preceded the ancient Hymn
by way of giving the singers their pitch, the lyre again
coming first in point of time.

Of the Lyre-Sung Preludes of the first stage, when they
were identical with the Nome, and also of the Preludes of
the second stage when they formed introductione to it,
we may well have examples among the Homeric H ymns ,-
but they were probably not all composed in hexameters
after the days of Terpander. One of the Nomes ascribed
to him was called The Trochczic, and he is praised by
Plutarch for introducing into music a beautiful style
called Terpandrean‚ It is clear that he not only added a
string to the lyre but was a rhythmical innovator as well.
That one of his Nomes was called Trochaic suggests that
hitherto the metre of such songs had been something else-—
in all probability the Hexameter. The ‘ Terpandrean ’
metre was likely enough the Spondaic, exemplified in at
least one extant fragment, that of a poem which was
ascribed to him in antiquity and was presumably one of
the famous Nomes—-possibly the Nome called Terpandrean ;
for it might have been called after the metre rather than the
composer, which would explain why among so many
Nomes ascribed to Terpander only one bore his name.1

We have corroboration of the view that the Nome was a
derivative of the Hymn, in the first fragment of Terpander,
where we find, in what is probably the beginning of the
Nome called Terpandrean‚ the poet referring to the first

1 the view that τροχαῖος in this connexion refers to the
tempo—‘ running ’—and not the rhythm, is less likely; cf. also
Stob. Ecl. i. 1. 31, where after an enumeration of deities in 9
hexameters we read ὑμνέωμες μάκαρας, Μοῦσαι Διὸς ἔκγονοι, ἀφθίτοις
ἀοιδαῖς, which, though it can hardly be earlier than the 4th
Century, may follow an old tradition
