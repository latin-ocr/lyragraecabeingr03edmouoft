EUMELUS: THE ELEAN HYMN

parative) certainties. thile the true Epic of the
Cycles, as opposed to the quasi-Epic of the Hesiodic
school, continues to flourish in Ionia, there a-rises
in Dorian Corinth an interesting figure, who on the
strength of his Processional to Delos, written before
the Spartan conquest of Messenia, appears in the
text-books as the first Lyric poet. But it should
be remembered that EUMELUS was also reputed an
Epic poet of the Trojan Cycle and a writer of history
in Epic verse. The last sounds like a new departure
—if it is true3 and it seems reasonable enough.
Formally it would be a natural development of the
theogonio element of the Epos ; in the great colonising
times of the 8th Century the colonists would welcome
a rhapsode who told them tales of their great ancestors
of the motherland; and Eumelus was not only a
contemporary but a kinsman of the man who founded
Syracuse from Corinth. His Processional Hymn,
which is written in what was then the only ‘ art ’-
metre, although it is doubtful whether Pausanias
means that it was the first sent by the Messenians
or the first ever sent, was probably by no means
unique as a fest-al song. There may well have been

, a demand, for instance, for wedding-songs long

before Alcman's day, and one at least of Sappho's
was written in the traditional Hexameter. It
smacks of the great days of expansion that these
lines of Eumelus, quoted—significantly—-as evidence
for a musical competition, testify to innovations in
poetry. The poet is clearly refusing to be bound by
convention.1

Side by side with t-he professional poetry of the
Epic tradition there existed now, no doubt, as always,
a body of folk·poetry which was soon to react, as
we shall see, upon the poetry of the great musical
contests. The Elean women's Hymn or Incantation
to Dionysus, though we have it in a modernised
version, is certainly very old, probably a good deal
