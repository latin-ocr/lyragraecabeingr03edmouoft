the wooded earth.' He ended, and the other’s
spirit bent not back, but he took his stand upon the
firm poop and leapt, and the precinct of the deep
received him right kindly. And the heart of the
son of Zeus was amazed within him, and he bade
them keep the cunningly-wrought ship before the
wind. But Destiny struck out another path.

The bark sped on amain, urged from astern by the
North-Wind’s breath, and all the tribe of Athenian
youth were affrighted when the hero leapt into the
sea, and shed tears from their lily eyes1 to think of
the woeful hap that needs must be. Meanwhile

its original use as an adjective, cf. Pind. N. 7. 79 λείριον
ἄνθεμον; λειρός (Hesyeh. ὁ ἰσχνὸς καὶ ὠχρός, ‘ thiu and pale‚')
and λειροφθαλμός (Suid. ὁ προσηνεῖς ἔχων τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς,
‘with gentle eyes') may or may not be connected ; perhaps
also ληροί (Hesyoh. τὰ περὶ τοῖς γυναικείοις χιτῶσι, ‘ the gold
piping of women's smocks ⁷) ; Boisacq favours the view that
λείριον is borrowed from Egyptian, comparing the Coptic
pupi: flower; the meaning is ‘bright young eyes‚' cf.
Shakespeare’s ‘young-eyed cherubins’ ² Poseidon’s
palace in the depths of the sea
