THE IAMBIC

it is not clear. We only know that he used this
word of his poetry, 01 of a certain kind of it. Whether
it had the meaning or not to Archilochus, however,
it is certain that when the word came 10 be used to
describe a form of literature, it came to connote
ridicule and invective, and the idea of ridicule seems
10 have joined in it wit-h that of improvisation.1

save that Trochaic and Iambic were sometimes

classed together 33 Iambic.

The earliest literary use of this metre, 33 we have seen,
is in the burlesque Homeric poem called the M amite-9,
where it is mixed with the Epic Hexameter. All we know
of the date of this poem 13 that it is earlier than Archilochus.
Like the Pentameter, the Iambic seems 1ο 113νο 001110 from

libation (see p. 512) and in the Eleusinian Mysteries. In
the Homeric H ymn to Demeter (7th 0011111157) 3 woman
named Iambe moves the sorrowing Goddess to ‘ laugh
and be cheerful with many a quip and jest,’ and we have
her definitely identified with 1111131 Iambic lines ε

and used in ritual all over Greece.
