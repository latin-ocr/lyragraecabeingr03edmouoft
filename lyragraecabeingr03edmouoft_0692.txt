DlTHYRAMB AND NOME

part of his poem as a ‘ beginning of Hymns.’ In Pindar
Nem. 2. 1, ‘ VVhere too the Homerid bards of stitched epic
lines for the most part begin, namely the prelude to Zeus,’
the reference is to the rhapsodes, and the προοίμιον 13
probably a short Hexameter address such as the xxiiird
H omerio H ymn. VVhet-her this Zeus-Prelude of Ter-
pander's would be suitable to a Nome sung in competition
at Delphi or at the Spartan Carneia, both held in honour
of Apollo, is not quite certain. It may have been per-
formed elsewhere 3 but it should be noted that the poetical
custom 01 ⁶ beginning with Zeus ’—though not perhaps
as old as the Theoqony, where ll. 47 ff. come awkwardly
and may well be an addition—is as old as Pindar. Timo-
theus’ Persae, which was probably written for a festival
of Poseidon, ends with an address to Apollo. The con·
tents of Terpander‘s Nomes can only be conjectured from
the incomplete Persae of his imitator, and from a general
comparison with the H omerio H ymns.

Among the earlier poets of the Nome, besides Ter-
pander, Lyric Nomes were ascribed before him to
Chrysothemis and Philammon, to the latter of whom
were sometimes attributed certain of the Nomes
generally called Terpander's; Arion’s ‘ Preludes to Epic
Poems‚’ of which there were two Books, were probably
Lyric Nomes3 so too perhaps were some at least of the
long narrative poems of Stesichorus, which he himself
calls Preludes‚ and of Ibycus, who was sometimes credited
with the Funeral Games of Pelias ‚· Lyric Nomes were
ascribed by Suidas' authority to Corinna.

In the latter half of the 5th Century comes Phrynis,
whose innovations‚ according to Proclus’ authority, were
‘ the combination 01 the Hexameter with free rhythms and
the use of 3 lyre of more than seven strings.' N ext to him
his pupil Timotheus, who ‘ brought the Nome to its
present condition.' Then follows a comparison with the
Dithyramb: ‘ The Dithyramb is full of movement and,
expressing by means 01 the dance a high degree of
“possession” or excitement‚ is directed to evoking the
emotions most characteristic of the God; wild, too, in its
rhythms, it nevertheless employs a simple phraseology.
The Nome on the other hand is sustained 1 in an orderly
and highly dignified style by the various characters it
