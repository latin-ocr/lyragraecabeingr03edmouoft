BACCHYLIDES

20
[Troicus]

Scholiast on Aristophanes [‘and have Kingship for your
wife ’] : He personifies Kingship as a woman. According to
Euphronius this is because Kingship is daughter of Zeus ; and
she appears to preside over the immortalisation·department,
which in Bacchylides belongs to Athena, where she promises
immortality to Tydeus.¹.

[PfflLoc'rETEs]

Scholia-st on Pindar [ζ from Lemnos ³] z This account tallies
With that of Bacchylides in the Dz'thyrambs in making the
Greeks fetch Philoctetes from Lemnos at the prophet-ic
bidding of Helenus. It seems that. it was fated that Ilium
should not be taken without the bow of Heracles.

Stobaeus Autholosly [Of the need of bearing one‘s lot like a
gentleman, because we are human and ought to live according
to virt-ue] ε Bacchylides ProcossionazS 2——

One goa] there is, one path, of mortal happiness,
the power to keep a heart ungrieving to life's end.
Whoso busieth his wits with ten thousand cares and
afflicteth his spirit night and day for the sake of
things to come, the labour of such an one beareth no
fruit. For what ease is there left us if we keep the
beart astir with vain lament Ρ 2 . . .
