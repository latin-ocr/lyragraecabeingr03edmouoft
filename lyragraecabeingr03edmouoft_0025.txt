LIFE OF CORINNA

Scholiast on Aristophanes A clearnians: Ἀγοράζειν :—
to behave in the market-place with arrogance of
manner and licence of speech; an Attic use of the
word, for using which in Book Ι of his Blaiden-Songs
Corinna takes Pindar to task.

Aelian Historical RIisveZlanies : When the poet
Pindar competed at Thebes he happened on ignorant
judges, and was defeated five times by Corinna. By
way of exposing their lack of good taste, he called
Corinna a sow.1

Pausanias Description of Greece: Corinna, the only
poet of Tanagra, is commemorated by a monument
in the open street and by a painting in the gym-
nasium. The latter represents her in the act of
putting on the headband she won when she defeated
Pindar in the lyric competition at Thebes. In my
opinion her victory may be set down first to her
dialect, because she did not sing like Pindar in
Doric, but 1n a dialect which Aeolians would under-
s,tand and secondly because, if one may really judge
from the portiait, she was at that time a remarkably
good- looking woman. 2

Introduction to Pindar: The names of the aforesaid
lyric poets are these z—Alcman, Alcaeus, Sappho,
Stesichorus, Ibycus, Anacreon, Simonides, Bacchy-
lides and Pindar, [some authorities add to these
Corinna].3

servatism with the broadenecl outlook which had come of
his sojourn at Athens—‘She is a mere Boeotian, I am a
Greek' ² Tae. adv. Gr. 33 mentions a famous statue
