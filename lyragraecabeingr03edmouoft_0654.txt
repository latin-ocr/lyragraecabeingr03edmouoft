vanee in elaboration on those of Ibycus. The metre, how-
ever, instead 01 being mainly Dactylic, is Glycmfic, Chori-
ambic, and Ionic, all new-Lesbian characteristics; and the
poems appear to be arranged sometimes in homorrhythmio
strophes 01 uneven length. The entire absence 01 the
Triad may be an accident.

The fragments 01 1110 Melie songs 01 love and
wine, in which Anacreon's sels-revelation comes
second only to Sappho'S‚ but which, to judge by
Horace’s words in the Ode Velox amoenum, included
narrative poems, have less fire and more sweetness
than those 01 Ibycus. Though the serious note is
not always absent 110111 them, they seem to betoken
a man who often played with love rather than loved,
and, as we should expect in such a man, invective

represents him as one singing in his cups.’

The latter half 01 the 6111 Century brought the
beginnings 01 a change which proved of capital
importance in the history of the world, t-he rise 01
Athens as the intellectual centre 01 Greece. Peisis-

saw to the editing 01 Homer and Hesiod, and regulated
the performance 01 1110 rhapsodes at the Panathenaic
Festival; Hipparchus brought Anacreon to Athens
and made Simonides, as we shall see, a court-poet3
the young Pindar was sent to Athens to learn his
