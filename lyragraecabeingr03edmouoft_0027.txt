CORINNA

Propertius Elegies: Nor is it 50 much her face,
fair though it be, that hath taken me captive . . .
'tis rather when the melody begins of that Aeolian
quill which can rival the lyre of Aganippe, 'tis when
5116 pits her own poetry against old Corinna’s, and

deems Erinna’s verse 1 no match for what she writes
herself.

Statius Greemvoods [to his father the school-
master]: Thou'rt skilled to expound the songs of
the Battiad‚2 or the secrets of the cramped Lyco-
phron, Sophron’s mazes or the ineagre Corinna's
mysterieS.

ἰών corresponding to ἐγώ, and ἱώνει to ἐγώνη-ἰέ we may
regard the Dorian η as changed to ει-, and ichvya correspond-
ing to ἐγώνγα. Compare Corinna (fr. 11); and in another
