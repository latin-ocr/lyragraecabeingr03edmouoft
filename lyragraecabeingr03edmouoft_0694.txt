THE ROMAN TWILIGHT

Tale of N inus, a papyrus which may belong to the last
Century before Christ, and the famous Milesian Tales
collected by one Aristeides and translated into Latin
in the time of Sulla. The Song 01 the Table survived
——chiefiy among hired musicians-——through the
Alexandrian Age3 Sappho and the Anacreontea were
still sung—by professionals—aiter banquets in the
2nd Century 01 0111 616. There was a long twilight,
but the sun had set.1

By the end 01 the Athenian Period‚ that is by about
330 B.c., which has been taken as the limit of this
book, most 01 1116 1011115 01 Greek poetry, including the
Drama, by the process 01 budding-off which began, it
would seem, with the early Hymn, appear to have
developed secular uses: 101 1116 honouring 01 111611 1611161
111611 Gods3 101 the imparting 01 general moral truths;
101 1116 expression 01 1161501161 love, hate, grief, joy;
101 111616 record or communication; for sheer enter-
tainment. In Melie poetry the hieratio tradit-ion
went on into Roman times, to give birth eventually
to the Christian Hymn 3 2 the secular forms, narrowing
in scope 01 occasion and choice 01 1116116, and growing
ever more a means to pleasure, survived the last
centuries B.c., mostly perhaps as recitation—poems.
The change was partly due no doubt to changing
economic conditions, but partly also to the ever-
increasing 1111 between the dialect 01 literature and
the idiom 01 common life, and not least to the gradual
supersession 01 1116 pitch-accent. Stress was resuming
its sway, and poetry sung in ‘ longs ’ and ‘ shorts ’ was
naturally felt to be too artificia] when the ‘ quantities ’
were coming to be ignored in speech. Another
cause, which began to work even in the days 01
Euripides, was doubtless the spread 01 two corrupting
practices which came 01 the over-elaboration of the
musical accompaniment, the singing 01 several notes
to a single syllable and the neglect 01 the pitch-accent
in composing the melody. So long as these practices
