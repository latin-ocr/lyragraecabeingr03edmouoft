LIFE OF PHILOXENUS OF CYTHERA

unexpected promise that his answer should preserve
both the truth and Dionysius' reputation. He was
true to his word. The despot's citations‚ it seems,
were descriptive of something pathetic, and in
answer to the request for his opinion Philoxenus
now replied, ‘ Pitial)le‚’ and by this equivoque made
his promise good. For Dionysius took the word
‘pitiable’ in the sense of ‘patlietic‚ full of pathos,'
and knowing that pathos was one of the points of a
good poet, understood the criticism as praise, while
the company, accepting the real sense ‘utterly
pitiable,’ realised that the prince was guilty of a
genuine lapse.1

Lucian Againsl the Unczcltured Man mlzo bought many
Books: Itis said that Dionysius wrote tragedy of a
sort so entirely feeble and ridiculous as to cause the
. repeated consignment of Philoxenus ’co the stone-
quarry because he could not forbear to laugh at it.
Realising that he was being put to scorn, the despot
procured at great pains the writing-tablet which
had been used by Aeschylus, and flattered himself
that he would draw inspiration from it. But alas!
he wrote still worse—for instance, ‘' Came Dionysius'
wife Doridium'; and, ‘Ah me! l’ve lost a service-
able wife,' that too came from the writing-tablet3
and again, ‘The fools that are among us mock
themselves.’ Now this last citation Dionysius might
have applied pat to your case. Had he done so,
he would have deserved to have that writing-tablet

gilded for him.
