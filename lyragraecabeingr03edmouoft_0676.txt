THE HYPORCHEME

ὄρχησις or Pyrrhich, which at first—always at Sparta— v
was a dance-at-arms, later a mimetic dance of more
general type associated at Athens with Dionysus. But
it was probably not confined to this use, being more
generally a dance of many accompanying a dance of few,
the few being silent and more mimetic than the many who
sang. Its characteristic metre was the Cretic (.-..‚-)‚
though this does not predominate in the longer extant
fragments and the names of certain metres, for instance
the hyporchematic prosodiae vvvvvvvvv Ι ------
point to a great widem'ng of the metrical scheme. We
have mention of Hyporchemes by Xenodamus, Pindar,
Bacchylides, Pratinas. The three most considerable
fragments, once given to Simonides (vol. ii, p. 330), are
now generally ascribed to Pindar. These, like the large
fragment of Pratinas on the over-importance given to the
fiute, are probably characteristic in the rapid motion of
their rhythm and the liveliness of their subject-matter.
As would be expected, the ‘ mode ⁹ employed was the
Dorian. There is no trace of strophio or triadic arrange-
ment. We are told that both sexes took part. According
to what is perhaps a late authority, the Hyporcheme was
performed by a chorus who ran round the altar while the
sacrifice was burning. This, which does not seem con-
sistent with the other evidence, may have been a late
development. Athenaeus compares the Hyporcheme
with the Cordax of Comedy by reason of its sportive
character. It was employed in Tragedy‚ for instance by
Sophocles Phil. 391 ff„ and is perhaps to be recognized
in Comedy, for instance at the end of the Ecclesiazusae.

Some of the songs of Greece, naturally, such as the
Μ111- Song and the Spinning- Song, never came upon
the stage of art; others, such as the Reaping- -,Song
only in the book· form of Alexandrian Bucolic
(Theocr. 10. 41ff.;) some, such as the Iobacchus,
made art, as it would seem, by Archilochus, were
superseded by other similar forms3 others were
indeed brought into art-poetry in Lesbos, but seem
to have had no vogue elsewhere in the classical
period. The Adoneion or ADONIS-SONG and the
Epithalamium or WEDmNc-SONG, both connected
with cults which made their chief appeal to women——
whence probably their lack of vogue in the Greece
