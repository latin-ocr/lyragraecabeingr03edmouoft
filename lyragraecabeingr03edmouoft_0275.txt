LIFE OF CINESIAS

Aristophanes Frogs: . . . or anyone who tries to
get money sent to the eneiny's fleet, or any singer
to the circular chorus who befouls the wayside
shrines of Hecate . . . all these Ι charge, and
charge again, and charge yet once again, to keep
away from our Mystic dance.

Scholiast on tlze passage: This is aimed at the
dithyramb-writer Cinesias.

The Same [to Iacchus]: Thou it is who hast had
our poor sandal split and our coat rent for fun and,
be it said, economy, and found out how we can
sport and dance without having to pay.

Scholiast on the passage: That is, they have been '
split on thy account . . . He seems to imply that
the poets’ plays had come to be staged on the
cheap. Anyhow Aristotle says that it was in the
archonship of this Callias (406 B.C., the date of the
play), that it was decreed that tragedies and
comedies should be produced together at the Dionysia;
so that perhaps there was a like combination for the
Lenaea3 and not long afterwards Cinesias finally
abolished the system of the staging of plays as a
State-service [for wealthy citizens]; whence Strattis
in the play he wrote upon him, speaks of ‘ the shop1
of Cinesias the chorus-slayer.'

On a slah of Pentelic mar-hle found belom tlze eastern
side of the Acropolis of Athens :

. -stratus of Phalerum provided the chorus . . .
Cinesias trained it.²

² prob. with a play on σκηνή, the ‘scene’ or back of the
stage of the theatre 2 this implies that the poet com-
posed the work performed
