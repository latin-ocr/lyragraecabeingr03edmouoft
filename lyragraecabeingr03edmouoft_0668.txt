THE PAEAN

of other peoples were probably very similar—the wine was
mixed in three bowls, from each of which the first ladleful
was poured on the ground to Olympian Zeus, the Heroas,
and Zeus the Saviour3 and then the whole company,
every man holding a laurel twig, sang the Paean. If a
fresh bowl was required, it was sung again. And some-
times there was yet another singing of it, to end the
evening’s festivity3 this last Paean was sung by the
host alone. The flute, the instrument proper to a sacrifice,
was the usual accompaniment, played by a hired flute-girl.
These dining-paeans were addressed primarily to Apollo,
but like their greater counterparts they came to associa-te
with him other deities such as Poseidon, or quasi-deities
such as Health or Virtue. The Paeans chosen were
mostly perhaps ‘ classics ’ ; we hear of those of Stesichorus,
of Τ5711111ο11115,1 of Pindar. The other songs of the feast,
Drinking-songs, Eulogies, were secular; the Paean, like
the English ‘ grace,' was sacred. The Paean was generally
Choral‚ the secular songs generally Μοῑ1ο<ῑ11ο.2

The traditional contents of a Paean seem to have been
first an invocation, then something of the nature of a
⁸ myth ² with occasional reference to present-day topics, and
finally a prayer. During the reign of the Hexameter‚ that
metre seems to have been employed. A survival of this use
is perhaps to be seen in the Hexameters that appear in the
’ Paean—like ode in the Oedipus Tyrannus (151 fh). Later,
as in the other kinds of Melie, the older rhythms resumed
their sway. The refrain either divided the couplets or
strophes, which, to judge by Aristophanes' song in the
Wasps (863 ff), sometimes extended to half the whole
poem, or made part of their last line 01· lines. In the latter
case we find it in certain of Pindar’s Paeans elaborated into
a short sentence, sometimes recurrent as in ii, sometimes
not, as in vi. In three of the four extant triadic Paeans of
Pindar, the refrain or refrain-sentence ends the Triad, and
it may have done so in the fourth (Ox. Pap„ 1791). Better
evidence for the structural evolution of Choral Melie
could hardly be wished for (see p. 62 1). In the Alexandrian
period, like other forms of Melie poetry, the Paean tended

1 so T. Reinach for ‘ Phrynichus ’ Ath. 250 b 2 or songs
originally choral sung as solos3 it was one advantage of the
absence of part-singing from ancient music that this was possible,
and this is one of the reasons that the line of distinction between
Choral and Monodic is sometimes so hard to draw
