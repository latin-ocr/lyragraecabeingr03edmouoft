Another variety of the ‘ Song-in-the-xapos’ was
the Eroticon or LovE-SONG.

This may be said to have had its prototypes, if not in
the Hymns to Love ascribed to the early bards and sung
at the Eleusinian Festival (see p. 594), in the Love-Elegies
of Archilochus and Mimnermus—which were probably
recited rhythmically to the fiute-and in the ribald songs
of another Ionian, Polymnastus. But Chamaeleon
ascribed the first Leve-Songs to Alcman. It is significant
that Alcaeus begs his beloved to ‘receive your serenader
(κωμάζοντα),’ that is napos-singen When the sym-
posium broke up, the guests went merrily through the
streets and lovers sought their loves. This rout was
called κῶμος. whether the Love-Song was sung at the
table like other Eulogies, or at the door of the beloved,
depended on circumstances. If the beloved was of the
opposite sex, the latter would more probably be the
occasion. In the hands of Sappho and Alcaeus, the
masters of Monody, the Eroticon quickly reached its
zenith. Ibycus, with his half-Dorian origin, was perhaps
the first to make it, as a court—poet might, like any other
Encomjum a choral song-dance,1 though it is not likely
that all his Love-Songs were Choral. The Ionian Anacreon,
truer to human nature, more consistently followed, we may
believe, the great Lesbians. The connexion of the Love-
Song with the Eulogy is marked by Pindar’s Encomium
to Theoxenus of Tenedos, the beautiful youth in whose lap
the aged poet is said to have died. This, which consists of
a single Triad, was probably sung and danced by a chorus
after a feast. In spite of the personal form of its expression
it has a strangely impersonal, almost unworldly, ring,
suited not only to the formality of its performance, but to
the character and, we may believe, the age, of its author.

Another and at first doubtless identical offshoot,
as it would seem, of the Symposiac Paean, was the
Scolion or DRINKING—SONG. Here again classification
apparently derives from a circumstantial and once
fortuitous distinction.

1 these perhaps are the παίδειοι ὕμνοι of Pindar, Is. 2. 1 ff.
