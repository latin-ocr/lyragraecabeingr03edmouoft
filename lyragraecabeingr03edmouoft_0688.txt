PHILOXENUS z TIMOTHEUS

waits on art-forms when they begin to appeal only
to the pleasure of the looker—on. This degeneration,
to judge by modern parallels, would be hastened by
the disastrous Peloponnesian KVar.

In the latter half of the 5th Century the chief
name is that of MELANIPPIDES, grandson of the earlier
Melanippides 3 at the end of the 5th and the beginning
of the 4th those of PHILOXENUS of Cythera, his pupil,
and Timotheus of Miletus

Melanippides introduced instrumental flute-preludes
and free rhythms—that is, astrophic arrangement—,
Philoxenus solo-songs.1 Aristodemus nevertheless, in
conversation with Socrates, is made by Xenophon to place
Melanippides with Homer, Sophocles, Polycleitus, and
Zeuxis, as a master of his tart. Philoxenus enjoyed a great
reputation both at Athens, and, later, at the court of
Dionysius at Syracuse. His famous Dithyramb The
Cyclops, in which he satirised the tyrant‚ who had crossed
him in love, was imitated by Theocritus. The large frag-
ment οἱ the Banquet which, clever though it is, shows the
Dithyramb at its worst, is probably the work of another
Philoxenus.

Of the eighteen famous Dithyrambs of his contempo-
rary TIMOTHEUS 2 we have but one line from the
Scylla. He raised the number of the strings of the
lyre to eleven, and made other bold musical inno·
vations which, after a period of great unpopularity,
eventually combined with his success with the Lyre· '
Sung Nome—of which presently—to make him the
most famous poet of his day. For his Hymn to
Artemis the Ephesians paid him a thousand gold
pieces. The after-influence of Philoxenus and
Timotheus may be gauged by the fact that two
hundred years after their death their N omes were
still taught to the young Arcadians (Polyb. 4. 20. 9).
There is one more famous name, that of TELESTES
of Selinus, who won his first victory in the Dithyramb
in 402.

1 this rests on a probable emendation of Westphal in Plut.
