CORINNA

Parthenius Lora Romances [on Aero]: The story goes
that Aero was the daughter of Oenopion and the nymph
Helice, and Orion the son of Hyrieus, falling in love with
her, asked her of Oenopion in marriage, and for her sake
reclaimed the island (of Chios) by purging it of the wild
beasts that infested it ; moreover he drove off large herds of
cattle from the neighbouring farms to be her bridal gift.
Oenopion, however, had no stomach for such a son—in-law,
and whenever the day was fixed deferred it, till one night,
fuddled with drink, Orion broke into the chamber where the

girl lay asleep3 whereupon Oenopion laid violent hands upon
him and put out his eyes with a firebrand.

Apollonius Pronouns [on the form τίν ‘thee ']: It is used
also by Corinna in the accusative 3 compare the Raturn:

for thou art not harmed by this jealous man 1

where τίν is for σέ by interchange of cases.

The Same : ἑοῦς ⁶ of him· z—This corresponds to the Doric

310ῦέὶοὶ thee‚' which is frequently used by Corinna ; compare
e e urn:

The mighty man Orion won the day, and gave all
the land his name.
