BACCHYLIDES
42

Stobaeus Antholoyy [on Injustice, Miserliness, and Covet-
ousness]: Bacchylides l·⁷i<·t07·y-Sonqs:

Let me say it once for all, gain overpowers the
finest wits.

42A

Scholiast on Aristides Panathenaicus: [⁶if indeed the
chariot too came originally from Athens and not from
Sicily ²] : He says this because some authorities declare that
the chariot was a Sicilian invention; for Bacchylides and
Pindar, when they sang the praises of Hiero and Gelo iu
respect of horsemanship, suggested that that art was invented
by the Sicilians.

431

Scholiast on the Odyssey [‘ the Centaur, famed Eurytion ³] ε ²
Bacchylides believes in a different Eurytion3 for according
to him, when he was a guest of Dexamenus iu Elis he insulted
his host's daughter and was slain by Heracles, who came
opportunely upon the scene.³

44-44 Α

Scholiast on the Iliad: Zeus saw Europa the daughter of
Phoenix plue-king flowers with the Nymphs in a meadow,
and falling in love with her, went down and changed himself
into a bull: and breathing saffron from his mouth beguiled
her, and took her on his back, and crossing the sea to Crete
made her his bride, and afterwards gave her to wife to
Asterion king of the Cretans, in whose house she bore three
sons, Minos, Sarpedon and Rhadamanthus. The story is

told by Hesiod and Bacchylides.⁴

as seems likely, the Dithyrambs were arranged alphabetic-
ally, this was prob. part rather of an Epinician than of a
Dithyramb
