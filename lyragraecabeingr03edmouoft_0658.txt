TIMOCREON

In default of the sels-revelation of monodic poetry‚

the basis of our estimate of Simonides naturally
includes the stories that gathered round his name.
Many of these record wise sayings, some of which are
proverbs still: ‘ F ortune favours the brave,’ ‘ Painting
is silent Poetry,’ ‘ Play all your life and never be entirely
in earnest-.’ On the other hand, there are references
even as early as Aristophanes to his penuriousness3 and
Pindar was supposed to hint at him where he says ⁶ The
Muse was no seeker os gain then, nor worked for hire,’
and the ancient comment is ‘ He means that nowadays
they compose victory-songs for pay, a custom begun by
Simonides.’ Pindar was probably referring to all con-
temporary poets including himself. It may be that the
Eulogy, being compliment-ary of an individual, was the
last form of poetry to be bought and sold, or that till
the end of the 6th Century poets had lived by teaching
the young, and regarded the composition of lyric poetry
and the training of choruses as acts of grace.
In any case a dispassionate survey of all the
external evidence suggests, not a niggard, but a man
of independent disposition who was not content to
live as a mere hanger-on of rich men, but believed
the labourer to be worthy of his hire3 and this is not
inconsistent with the great kindly humorous soul
that beams from the Dana& and the Epitaphs.
Sappho was supreme in the solo-song, the personal
lyric; Simonides was great because he took the
choral lyric, the collective epitaph'—the impersonal
song, the song of the tribe—and made it, humanly
speaking, personal.

Among the fragments of Simonides are certain after-
dinner impromptus, which, like some of the dedi-
catory Inscriptions, show the marvellous technical
ingenujty that comes of a life spent in handh‘ng
words. The dinner-table was clearly the venue of
his passage—at-arms with a man who, significantly
of the period, combined the Lyric and Iambic poet
with the Comedy-writer, and strangely enough was
a five-event champion as well, TIMOCREON of Rhodes.
By the irony of fate Timocreon owes the preservation
of his most considerable extant fragment to his having
