THE LYRIC POEMSl OF ION OF CHIOS
1

Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner [on wine]: And in Ion of
Chios we read ε

wild buli-faced child [of Zeus and Semele*-v ?],

young and yet old, sweetest servitor of lond-thunder-
ἱῐιιιξ 2Ψὲῗ1ἶϊεε, wine that cheers the heart and rules

23

Scholiast on Aristophanes Peace [‘ And who is the star up
there now ?—Ion of Chios, who on earth once composed the
δίαν of Moru, and they all called him that directly he got to
heaven ³] : A writer of dithyrambs‚ tragedies, and lyric
poems ; among others, of the song beginning z

Let us wait for the Star of Morn that haunts the
sky, the white-winged forerunner of the Sun.

From this it appears that the poet was dead. His being
called Star of Moru is therefore a jest of Aristophanes.

3

Scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes [Aegaeon]: According
to a Dithyramb of Ion he was summoned from the ocean ⁴
and carried up to be a guard of Zeus; the same authority
makes him a son of the Sea.

4

Introduction to Sophocles’ Antigone : Accounts of the
heroine and her sister Ismene vary ; Ion declares in his
Dichyrambs that they were both burnt to death in the temple
of Hera by Laodamas son of Eteocles.
