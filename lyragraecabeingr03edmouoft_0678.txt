THE DlRGE

the chief part of the song—‚ and after a climax consisting of
a promise to choose a tree to be called and worshipped as
Helen’s, ends a farewell to the happy pair with the line

Ὑμὴν ὦ Ὑμέναιε, ’γάμῳ ἐπὶ τῷδε χαρείης,

which, as well as the topics of the song, may be traditional.
Part 01 0110 earlier example (Sa. 66), if it was written for a
real wedding and 1s not a mere tale 111 song, a Lyric Nome
like those of Stesichorus, is remarkable as containing (or
bei ng in the form of) a myth. With one exception which
is open to the same doubt (146), all the other fragments of
Sappho’s ixth Book appear to be concerned with the
ἓξὲῗέᾞᾲπᾞ {²15³ ἓὲξὲιῗὲῗίοῗὲ '⁵253’ ἷὲἕ ξῖἷὲἓεῃῗὲἶὲἲῗ
and here, as in Theocritus, we find banter, but not only
of the bridegroom. The lines on the doorkeeper are com-
posed in a sort of ‘ Half-hexameter,’ like the meshymnie 1
fragment (148) but with the first two ‘ shorts ' of any
length. Sappho indeed seems to have employed various
metres for this kind of song, including, like her imitators
Catullus and Theocritus, the traditional art-form, the
Hexameter. Her ⁶ Half—hexameters ’ and her Glyconics—
and with 1110 latter we may compare Catullus’ other
Ε pi thalamy and the 1110110 of 1110 wedding-refrain—probably,
as we have seen, came from popular forms. The Wedding-
Song naturally appears sometimes in Attio Drama, for
instance at the end of Aristophanes’ Peace and in the
T rojan Women of Euripides. We also hear of a Wedding-
Song by Philoxenus, which was perhaps exceptional for
the 111110. Telestes’ Hymenaeus was a Dithyramb.

The Homeric form of the Thi-enos or DmcE has ·
already been described. Its chief occasion was the
laying-out of the corpse, but in Athens, at any rate,
it was probably sung also on the thirtieth day after
the burial and repeated at the anniversary of death.
The existence of a traditional Flute-Nome called Epi-
tymbidian or Over-the-Gravc ,· 1110 derivation of Elegy,
sung to the flute‚ from the lament; and the practice in
5th·Century Athens of making a prose laudation over the
dead, point to its having been performed sometimes at

the actual burial. Two, at any rate, of the popular forms
which stand behind the Dirge are the Ialemus and the
